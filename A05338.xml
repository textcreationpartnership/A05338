         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For Monſieur Roze not long ſince Biſhop of Senlis, and now the great Maſter of the Colledge of Nauarre, and Rector of the Vniuerſitie, cauſed the morrow after, and that by his moſt ancient Bedle, or ſtaffe bearer, both furniture and perſons to be prepared therefore.

Afterwards there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed three by three, ſome fiftie or threeſcore religious perſons, as well Franciſcane Friers, as Iacobins, blacke Friers, hoodded Friers, Minimes, bon hommes, Feuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, and others all couered with their cowles and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, buckled and armed, according to the ancient catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faſhion,<note place="margin">Much.</note> and according to the manner of the Epiſtles of S.

Amongſt the reſt there were ſixe Capuchins, or blacke Iacobine Friers, hauing euery one a morraine on his head, and vpon the ſame a cockes feather, cloathed alſo with coates of maile, their ſword girt to their ſide vpon their habits, one carrying a ſpeare, another a croſſe, the one a ſword, the other a harquebuze, and the other a croſſebow, all ruſticall and clowniſh thorough Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like humilitie: all the reſt almoſt had pikes, which they did oftentimes ſhake, for want of better paſtime, ſauing a fueillant Frier which was lame, who armed all vpon the bare, aſſayed to make roume with a two handed ſword, and a battaile axe at his girdle, his Portuiſe hanging be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, and he made a goodly ſhewe vpon one foote, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as it were a little mill before the Ladies.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind was the Prior of the Iacobins, very well appoynted, drawing a bowed or crooked haldberd after him, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med lightly or ſleightly, as one in a dead pay.

Alſo there came Madam de Nemours, repreſenting the Queene Mother, or the grandmother (but that is doubtfull) of the King that ſhould be, and there bare vp her taile, or (if we ſhould ſpeake courtlike) her traine, Madamoiſelle de la rue, the daughter of that noble and diſcreet perſon,<note place="margin">Honorable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance.</note> Monſieur de la rue, heretofore a cutter of garments, or a tailor, dwelling vpon S.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4210:9"/> of it, and Madame the Lieutenant of the eſtate &amp; crowne of France, waited vpon with the Ladies of Belin, and of Buſſie the Clerke. Then Monſieur the Lieutenant ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and cauſed himſelfe to bee ſeene, and before him two Heraults furred with Hermines, and at his ſides two Wallons carrying coates of armes very blacke, all beſet with the red croſſes of Lorraine, hauing before and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, a deuiſe in imbroiderie, the bodie whereof repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the hiſtorie of Phaeton, and the poeſie was this:<note place="margin">Phaetons ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie fit for this proceſſion.</note> 
               <hi>In magnis voluiſſe ſat eſt:</hi> that is, in great matters it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to haue a will. As ſoone as they were come in this apparell and order into the Chappell of Bourbon, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Rector Roze, putting off his halfe cowle, or tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, as alſo his ſword and partiſane, went vp into the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,<note place="margin">As well as he could.</note> where hauing prooued by good and forcible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that this was the time, wherein all ſhould go well with them, propounded vnto them one godly, expedient and profitable way, to put an ende to the warre within ſixe moneths at the furtheſt, reaſoning thus. In France there are ſeuenteene hundred thouſand ſteeples or chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, whereof Paris is accounted but for one alone:<note place="margin">Soone ſayd.</note> now take out of euery church one catholike man to be a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and to goe to warre at the charges of the pariſh, and let the monies be managed by the Doctors of Diuinitie, or at the leaſt by certaine Graduats to be named, we ſhal make twelue hundred thouſand fighting men,<note place="margin">They neede many for ſo great vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minings.</note> and fiue hundred thouſand pioners. Then al the aſſiſtants or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie were ſeene to leape for great ioy, and to crie, O ſtroke or blow from heauen. Afterwards he did liuelie exhort them to warre, and to die for the Lorraine Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yea and if neede were, and rather then faile, for the moſt Catholike King: and this he did with ſuch earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and vehemencie, that hardly could they reſtraine his regiment of Friers, &amp; tutors, or ſchoolemaſters, that they had not preſently runne to take the forts of Gournay, and S.

               <p>BEfore I ſpeake vnto you, touching the ceremonies, and the order of the ſeates of the ſayd Eſtates, it ſhall not be beſides the purpoſe, to portraite and figure out vnto you the diſpoſition and order of the hall where the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie was to be kept. The carpenters worke, and the ſcaffoldſhip for the ſeates, was altogether like to that of the eſtates which were held at Troyes, in the time of Charles the 6.<note place="margin">A pretie, though not ſo right a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance.</note> at the inſtance &amp; purſuit of the K. of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land &amp; the Duke of Burgundie, when Charles the 7. the Dolphin, and true heire of the Crowne of France, was degraded by the ſayd eſtates, &amp; declared vncapeable to ſucceed in the kingdome, &amp; he and all his adherents and fauourers excommunicated,<note place="margin">Or as we ſay, with booke bell &amp; candle.</note> aggrauated and reaggraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, bels ſounding, and candles put out, afterwards bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed (howbeit but for a ſeaſon). But the tapiſtrie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the ſayd hall was hanged, being twelue peeces or thereabout, ſeemed to bee made in our age, and plainely wrought, yet richly garniſhed, in the vpper border, and the cloath or chaire of eſtate, vnder which Monſieur the Lieutena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſhould ſit, was of the ſame. At one of the ſides and parts of the cloath or chaire of eſtate, there was liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented one Sertorius, apparelled after the French faſhion, amongſt the Spanyards, asking counſel of a hind appointed thereto, from which he he ſaid, he vnderſtood
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4210:10"/> the will of the gods. On the other coaſt or ſide there was the ſhape of Spartacus, making his oration to an armie of ſlaues, whom he had cauſed to be armed and to reuolt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Romane Empire. In the third there was the portraiture of the foreſayd perſon, hauing a torch in his hand, and came to ſet fire on a temple: &amp; at the neather part of the ſame ſide, there was written, <hi>If I cannot by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by ruine I will quench.</hi> The fourth could not be ſeene by reaſon of the obſcuritie or darknes againſt the ſhewe of it. On the head and below the ſayd cloath or chaire of eſtate, there was a crucifix,<note place="margin">New things beſt pleaſe.</note> according to the preſent ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe of Paris, hauing the left hand tied to the croſſe, and the right hand free or vnbound, holding in it a naked ſword, about which was written this ſaying, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon thee, and vpon thy bloud.</hi> Without the three coaſts or ſides, and before, there were the falles of Icarus and of Phaeton, very well wrought, and it made a goodly ſhew to ſee the ſiſters of this young fellow, by metamorphoſis, to be turned into popular trees, one of which, who had broken her hippe in running to ſuccour her brother, did naturally &amp; liuely reſemble the Dowager of Montpenſier, all her haire hanging about her eares.</p>
               <p>The firſt peece of tapiſtrie nigh to the cloath or chaire of eſtate, was the hiſtorie of the golden calfe, as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the 32. chap. of Exodus, where Moſes and Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron were there repreſented by King Henry the 3. lately dead, and Monſieur late Cardinall of Bourbon:<note place="margin">Some fitnes in theſe repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</note> but the golden calfe was the figure of the late Duke of Guiſe, lifted vp on high and adored by the people: and the two tables ſignified the fundamentall law of the Eſtates of Blois, and the Edict of Iulie made in the yeare 1587. and in the lower part of the peece theſe wordes are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>In the day of vengeance I will viſite euen this their ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond peece was a great countrie as it were of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers hiſtories both old &amp; of this age, diſtincted and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated one of them from another, and notwithſtanding
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4210:11"/> very wittily referring themſelues to the ſame perſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. In the vpper part of it there was to bee ſeene that goodly entrance by night, which Iohn Duke of Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die made into Paris, and when the Pariſiens cryed Chriſtmas from the feaſt of all Saints. At one of the corners was Harelle of Roan, where a Merchant cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led le Gras,<note place="margin">A good choiſe and a meet ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for that place.</note> that is, groſſe or fatte, was choſen King by the common people. At the other corner were the Iacke men of Beuoiſin, with their Captaine Guillaume Caillet: at the corner below were the pretie pigges or hogges of the league of Lions: and at the other corner were the noble acts of the ancient Maillotins, vnder theſe Captaines Simonnet Caboche, and Iacques Aubriot, the Kings of Buchers and Pillers, and the whole in men cut ſhort and ſeruing for nothing but for the countrey. But at the bottome and in the midſt of the peece there were expreſſed by figure and liuely ſet out the barricados of Paris, where men might behold a King (who was ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, plaine, and a good Catholike, and who had done ſo many good turnes, and giuen ſo many priuiledges to the Pariſiens) to be driuen out of his owne houſe, and beſet on all ſides with tunnes and barrels to take him. There were repreſented alſo diuers braue ſtratagems, or warlike deuiſes,<note place="margin">Meet men to manage ſuch matters.</note> of the Sirs or Knights, who did leade Tremont, Chaſtigneray, Flauacourt, and other rammers of the pauement (we call them pauiers) to the place of honour: and in the loweſt part of the ſayd peece were written theſe foure verſes:
<q>
                     <l>Iupiter with his tunnes or fats</l>
                     <l>Doth bring vs good and ill alſo:</l>
                     <l>But by theſe new vpſtarts he doth</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The third peece contained the hiſtorie of Abſalom, that with barricados diſtreſſed his father, and draue him out of the citie of Ieruſalem, hauing by vnworthie enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and making much of, gained and corrupted the moſt baſe and beggerly porters of the common people.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4210:11"/> Afterwards there was ſhewed the puniſhment that he receiued therefore, and how Achitophel his wicked counſellor, did accurſedly finiſh his daies: all the faces and countenances approched nigh vnto, or were like to ſome of the ſayd Eſtates: and there were eaſily knowne the Preſident Ianin, Marteau, Ribault, &amp; others, to whom the late Duke of Guiſe made ſo many goodly ſhewes in the aſſemblie of the Eſtates at Blois:<note place="margin">Faire words make fooles faine.</note> alſo there were ſeene Choulier, la Rue, Pocart, Senault, and other but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and horſe courſers, euen as baſe and low as dike-clenſers, and kennell rakers, all people and perſons of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in their occupations, which the foreſayd dead mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr did kiſſe on their mouthes for zeale of religion.</p>
               <p>The fourth repreſented in groſſe the feates of armes of the murthers done in old time and in our age alſo, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe called Bedouins and Arſacides, who feared not to goe and kill, euen in the chamber and in the bed, thoſe whom their imagined Prince Aloadin,<note place="margin">It ſeemeth to me he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Pope, or ſome that hold that part.</note> ſurnamed the olde, of ſixe or ſeuen mountaines, ſhould commaund them. Amongſt others there were two very apparant fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, the one of a certaine Countie of Tripoli, murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a Sarazin, zealous of his religion, whileſt he kiſſed his hands: the other of a King of France and Poland, trayterouſly ſtriken with a knife, by a wicked Monke or Frier, yet pretending zeale vpon his knees, preſenting vnto him a letter ſent him: and vpon the forehead of the ſayd Monke or Frier, there was written in great letters, the tranſpoſition of the letters of his name, Frier Iames Clement, IT IS HEL THAT HATH CRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATED ME.</p>
               <p>In the fift men might behold the battaile of Senlis, where Monſieur d'Aumale was made Conſtable, and had giuen him for his labour, the winged and hot ſpurres by Monſieur de Longueville, a politike Prince, and an arme of yron by la Noue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Givry his ſuffragan.

Yea I can ſay further, and that in trueth, that the death of my brethren hath not ſo farre cauſed my paſſions to breake forth (whatſoeuer goodly ſhew I made thereof) as the deſire I haue to walke in the waies and paths that my father and my good vncle the Cardinall had traced out before me, and which my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Balafre was happily entred.

And it fell out well, in which Madame my mother, my ſiſter, my wife, and couſin d'Aumale (who are here to giue mee the lye for it, if I doe not ſpeake true) did very catholikely aſſiſt me. For they and I had no more great paine and care, then to lay a ground worke for the warre, and in ſo doing to comfort and diſcharge all the deuout habitants good Catholikes, of the weight of their purſes, and to giue them leaue curiouſly to roue vp and downe, with their feete and their hands, to ſeeke and to ſeaze for vs the rich iewels of the Crowne, belonging vnto vs in the collaterall line, and by the forfeiture of Lord of the fee. We found much vnprofitable treaſure: we diſcouered with a little expence, by the reuelation of a catholike maſon, and the holie innocencie of Monſieur Machaut (whom I name here for honours ſake) the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and large muguot of Molan,<note place="margin">Becauſe he ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued your turne</note> notwithſtanding his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels and familiar ſpirits that kept it, whom the ſayd Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaut knew powerfullie and skilfully to coniure, ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly filling the bottome or ſoules of his hoſt with crownes of the ſumme.

In ſo much that afterwards our dearly beloued couſin her husband, ſhe her ſelfe and her chiefe page, did greatly performe their buſineſſes, and were healed of their catholike iaundiſe, wherewith they were made yellow from the time of the warres that they had for their Countie of Boulongne, catholikely &amp; law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deuolued vnto them, by the merite of their Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſters and deuout proceſsions, and not by vſurpation, or domeſtical the euerie, as theſe relapſed heretikes ſay. This being done to declare my liberalitie and magnificence, after that I was aſſured of ſundrie townes, caſtles and churches, which eaſily ſuffered themſelues to be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by good preachers, vpon whom I beſtowed part of my bootie, I prepared this puiſſant and glorious armie of olde ſouldiers vſed to the warres, all freſhly furbiſhed; which I brought in a very good order and diſcipline, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to Tours, where I thought to ſay as a catholike Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar, <hi>I came, I ſawe, I ouercame.</hi> But that fauourer of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes cauſed to come in poſte this Biarnois, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I would not attend ouer nigh, nor ſee him in the face,<note place="margin">For comming to nigh an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike, or ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning battaile with him.</note> leſt I might be excommunicate: and further you know, that the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uying of the ſiege of Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Beſides, you know to what point we were brought, when that tyrant fortified with the heretikes, came to beard vs, and to take Eſtampes and Pontoiſe: but by the good and deuout prayers of the fathers Ieſuits, and the interceſsion of Madame my ſiſter, and the interceſsion of diuers holie and religious confeſſors, we found out that holie martyr, which cauſed to ſound that blow from heauen, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:4210:18"/> vs out of the miſerie and captiuitie, into which we were readie and like within few daies to fall. In ſo much, that hauing taken breath, and made new attempts, and new bargaines with our good moſt Catholike King and nurſing father, I lifted my hornes on high, and with a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant armie deuided into two parts, I went to haſten to go gainſt the Maheutres, who following the good aduiſe, which my ſaid Ladie and ſiſter had receiued concerning the ſame, would haue fled beyond the ſeas with a ſmall traine: but becauſe they found not their veſſels readie at Diepe, where I was to viſite them, I put my ſelfe in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to bring them all priſoners to you in this citie, and you doe well remember, with what aſſurance I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed it to you,<note place="margin">But not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the greater ſhame.</note> and with what preparations you looked for it. Notwithſtanding, when I ſaw that theſe heretikes made vs beards of dung, and all to berayed vs, and that they would not ſuffer themſelues to bee taken without mittons or winter gloues, I fled into Flanders to ſeeke ſuch things there, and left them in the meane while to make that packe of ſtuffe in the ſuburbes of this citie, and afterwards ſuffered them to goe and walke all the winter long to Vendoſme, to Mans, Laual, Argentan, Faleze, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lençon, Vernueil, Eurenx and Honfleur, which I let them take very plainly, certainly aſſuring my ſelfe that ſhortly after I ſhould haue all their bootie in groſſe, when they ſhould haue taken a very great cold, and be readie to dye therewith.<note place="margin">Brauadoes are but ſimple feare-bugges.</note> And indeed I did very brauely make them lift vp their breech at Dreux, and they had fled away, if they would haue beleeued me. But you knowe that this put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off and on, protracting alſo the time, coſt vs well: for theſe wicked politikes would haue nothing but me, and they would haue diſhonored me, if they could haue ioyned with me, from which I knew well how to keepe my ſelfe, by the good example of my couſin of Nemours, and of my beloued and truſtie couſins alſo the Duke d' Aumale, and the Knight his brother, who had not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the way to Mante.

In ſtead that I was to goe, to ſeeke, and begge a maſter in Flanders, and there it was that I chaunged my French couerture or cloake into a cape after the Spaniſh manner, and gaue my ſoule to the Southerne diuels, to vngage that, which I had as moſt deare within this citie. But I tell you plaine I would haue as ſoone become Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifers ſeruant, as ſeruant to the Duke of Parma, that I might worke deſpight to the heretikes. I will not paſſe vnder ſilence the cunnings, ſleights &amp; inuentions, which I vſed to buſie and to retaine the people, and thoſe that thought to eſcape vs, wherin I cannot but acknowledge, that Madame my ſiſter here preſent, and Monſieur the Cardinall Caieran haue done very expreſſe and notable ſeruices to the faith, by ſubtill newes and <hi>Te Deums</hi> ſung to purpoſe, and by counterfeited cloathes in the ſtreete of the Lumbards, who haue giuen occaſion to many to dye chearfully with the rage of famine, rather then to ſpeake of peace.

Wee haue alreadie practiſed two moſt famous Legats to helpe vs to ſell our ſnaile ſhels: We haue had pardons gratis, or of free coſt, without vntying our purſes, &amp; wee know with what bias wee muſt take our holie father, threatning him a little with making peace, if he yeeld &amp; grant vs not that which wee demaund of him. Haue wee not had from Rome lightenings and thunderings, by hooke and by crooke, againſt our politike enemies? Haue not we cauſed them to be excommunicate, and to become blacke as diuels? We haue cauſed Paradiſes to bee continued to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and attempts:<note place="margin">He meaneth the citie and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſitie of Paris.</note> we haue before hand inſtructed the preachers, that are faithfull, and ſuch as haue learned to lay pawnes to gage, vnder good title. Wee haue cauſed the brotherhoods of S.

Wee haue cauſed to bee ſowen vnder hand, and that throughout all France, the Catholicon of Spayne, yea ſome ſuch Doublons, or double Duckets, as haue had meruailous effects, euen to the blew politike cords. What could I haue done more, but to giue my ſelfe to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels for the pledge and aduancement of Hyrie, as I haue done? Reade Ioſephus bookes, touching the warres of the Iewes, for that is as it were ſuch another fact as ours is, and iudge whether thoſe hote fellowes, Simon and Iohn, haue had more inuentions and diſguiſements of their matters, to make ſtiffe and obſtinate the poore people of Ieruſalem, to dye thorowe the rage of famine, then I haue had, to cauſe to dye with the ſame death, a hundred thouſand ſoules within this citie of Paris: yea to proceed ſo farre, that the mothers ſhould eate their owne
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:4210:19"/> children, as they did in that holie citie. Reade this hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie I pray you, and for the cauſe aboue ſpecified, and ye ſhall finde that I haue not ſpared any more then they did the moſt holie reliques and things of greateſt vſe in the Church, that I could cauſe to bee molten for my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres. I haue a hundred times broken my faith, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſworne to my friends &amp; kindred, that I might come to that which I deſired, without making ſhewe of it: and my couſin the Duke of Lorraine, and the Duke of Sauoy, knowe well what to ſay concerning this poynt, whoſe affayres I haue alwayes ſet behinde the cauſe of the French Church, and mine owne matters. And as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing publique faith, I haue alwayes ſuppoſed that the ranke or degree which I holde, did ſufficiently diſpenſe with me therefore: and the priſoners which I haue held with mee, or cauſed to pay raunſome againſt my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or againſt their compoſition that I made with them, cannot any whit at all vpbrayd me, becauſe I haue abſolution for it from my great amner and confeſſor. I will not ſpeake of the voyages which I haue cauſed to me made againſt the Biarnois, to aſtoniſh and at once to amaze him, where I neuer thought it. The cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningeſt on my ſide haue been imbarqued therein, and haue felt nothing thereof, but the freſhnes of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.

And if the Biarnois would haue beleeued ſome one or other of his Councell, who haue a graine of this Catholicon vpon their tongue, and who haue alwayes cryed out, that they muſt make nothing more ſharpe, for feare of making all deſperate, wee ſhould now haue faire play, in ſtead that we ſee the

There was neuer man that aſcended ſo high as I am, that would come downe but by hie force. There are many gates to enter into the power which I haue, but there is but one onely iſſue to get out of it, and that is death. This is the cauſe why I (ſeeing that a heape of politikes that are amongſt vs would offer vnto vs the head of their peace, and of their French monarchie) haue aduiſed my ſelfe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto them a maske and mummerie of the Eſtates, &amp; after that I had differred it, as long as I could, to illude, and make to waxe cold the preſent purſuites of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, and I haue called you here together with you to giue order thereto, &amp; to turne ouer together their quiers, that ſo I may know where the diſeaſe holdeth them, and who are our friends, and who are our enemies. But yet not to lye vnto you herein,<note place="margin">A ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of good conſcience.</note> I doe it for no other purpoſe then to ſhut vp their beakes and bils, and to make them beleeue that we trauaile very much for the publike good, and minde very willingly to make an agreement for

Yet ſo it is, that this cannot be done ſo ſoone, and there is yet a Maſſe to bee ſayd, and there muſt be made a great breach in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, becauſe it will be conuenient, that we giue a good part of it to them that ſhould helpe vs in this buſines. On the other ſide, you well foreſee the daungers and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences of peace, which ſetteth all things in order, and yeeldeth right to whom it appertaineth: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is much better to hinder it, then to thinke of it. And concerning my ſelfe, I ſweare vnto you,<note place="margin">A holie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious oath.</note> by the deare and welbeloued head of mine eldeſt ſonne, that I haue no veine that reacheth not thereto, and I am as farre from that, as the earth is from heauen: for although I haue made ſhewe by my laſt declaration, &amp; by my ſubſequent anſwer, that I do deſire the conuerſion of the King of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre, I pray you to beleeue, that I deſire nothing leſſe: and that I loue rather to ſee my wife, my nephew, and all my couſins and kinsfolkes dead, then to ſee this Biarnois at Maſſe, that is not the place where I itch. I haue not written and publiſhed it, but with a purpoſe and deuiſe, euen no otherwiſe then Monſieur the Legate maketh his exhortation to the French people. And all thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts or writings which Monſieur of Lions hath made, and will make concerning that ſubiect or matter, are not but of an intent to hold the people in wayting for ſome good aduenture (you vnderſtand me well) which the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Ieſuits will procure to make a ſecond holie martyr. And from elſewhere, it is as much diuiſion and as great weakening and infeebling to our enemies, and as great preparatiues for the third ſide, where wee haue alſo a good part, as being a great meane, if it clatter and make a

But wee haue ſtirred vp our Ambaſſadors of Spayne, to proteſt againſt their audience, and againſt that that the Pope would doe, concerning the pretended conuerſion of the Biarnois. Monſieur the Legate hath ayded vs to make our remembrances and inſtructions, and for his part will imploy therein all his abilities and ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federations of the Conſiſtorie.<note place="margin">Strong props.</note> And if his holines doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, I know well how we muſt haue reaſon therein and bring him thereto, namely, by threatning him that wee are very well able to make in this caſe our owne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement and accord with the politikes, and that with the loſſes and diſaduantage of the Church of Rome. Alſo would you not counſell me that for one Maſſe, which the King of Nauarre ſhould cauſe to bee ſung (which God forbid) I ſhould demiſe my ſelfe from the power that I haue, and of a halfe King that I am, to become a ſeruant, that ſo I might cauſe the tempeſt of this warre to fall vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

It is very true, that if the ſayd conuerſion fall out in good earneſt, I ſhall be in great paine and trouble, and ſhall hold the woolfe by the eares. Notwithſtanding, Monſieur of Lions, and our good preachers haue taught me, that it is not in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God to pardon a relapſed heretike, and that the Pope himſelfe cannot giue him abſolution, no not in the very article or poynt of death, which wee ought to holde for the thirteenth article of our faith,<note place="margin">New Creedes ioyned.</note> and adde it to the Apoſtles Creed: yea, that if the Pope would intermeddle in it, wee would make him himſelfe to bee excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate by our mother of Sorbonne, who knoweth more Latin then he,<note place="margin">Good praiſe.</note> and drinketh more Catholikely then the Conſiſtorie of Rome. This then is the poynt, vpon which we muſt principally inſiſt, by what meanes we ſhall hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the peace, and ſhall make immortal warre in France. Monſieur of Lions knoweth very well that the King of Spayne and I, haue promiſed him vpon our honour, a red hat, if he can doe ſo much by his rhetorike, to come to that end; and his ſiſter hath alreadie receiued for pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges a carcan or little cheſt of three thouſand Duckets, and a chaine of Catholike pearles, with a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Doublons, or double Duckets.

                  <hi>Quia non vult mortem peccatoris, ſed vt reſipiſcat:</hi> that is, becauſe he will not the death of a ſinner, but rather that he ſhould repent, as ſome haue done: and notwithſtanding he is an heretike, or accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for ſuch a one: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Monſieur the Lieutenant is worſe then an heretike, becauſe he hath cauſed to bee hanged his beſt friends, who put the bread into his hands To ſay that this was done, <hi>ad maiorem cautelam:</hi> that is, for better heede and greater ſubtiltie, or to bring downe the pride and inſolencie of the ſixteene, that is good: notwithſtanding in the meane while they were hanged. And this ſaying cannot hinder, that we bee not alwaies iudged and reputed great dolts &amp; blockheads, that is in Latin and French ſots, for that we haue indured
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:4210:38"/> him ſo long: and which is worſe, that the politikes may conclude in mood and figure, that Sorbonne can erre: a matter I tel you, that would make me once againe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come mad, and runne vp and downe the ſtreetes. For if this one ſhould haue place, wee ſhould neuer bee able to proue, by all the flowers of our rhetorike, nor by all the fundamental lawes of the kingdome, on which Monſieur of Lions hath relied ſo much, and made ſo great recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that ſo many ten thouſands of poore chriſtians, as wee haue made, and daily doe make to dye, with ſword,<note place="margin">Death for trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, counted martyrdome, with theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d doctors.</note> with famine, with fire, by our headlong decree, ſhould be iudged true martyrs, if it be ſo that our foreſayd decree be not able to abſolue them from the oth of fidelitie and naturall obedience, that ſubiects owe vnto their Prince. Wherfore Meſſieurs, I ſupplicate you, in the name of our Academie, to couer with a cloake this worthie fact here, the moſt catholikely that you can, as Monſieur the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate doth the intentions of Pope Sixtus, who loued not the League ſo dearly as ſome ſayd he did. Furthermore, I will furniſh you with ſo many places and paſſages of ſcripture, as you would haue, for I haue of them euen to ſell againe. But aboue all things, I recommend vnto you,<note place="margin">The belly hath no eares, though it haue a mouth to ſpeake.</note> Meſſieurs, our penſions, and of my maſters or fellow Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the holie facultie of theologie, as alſo of my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters the Curats and Preachers for whom I ſpeake. For you haue to doe with vs, and you are not able to paſſe theſe things. And Madame of Montpenſier knoweth well enough to ſay, that ſhe gayned more townes, and diſpatched more work with a very few double Duckets, which ſhe diſtributed to the preachers and Doctors, then the King of Nauarre did with all his taxes and armies. I doe in good time aduertiſe you, that if you furniſh and fit not the appoyntment, there is danger, leaſt wee giue our ſelues whollie ouer to proue,<note place="margin">He meaneth their rents and reuenues, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie.</note> that it is beſt to haue a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full King, though wayward and wicked, ſeeing hee will leaue vnto vs the bread of the chapiter, and purgatorie, without innouating any thing till the Councel that ſhall
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:4210:39"/> be. But in expecting that, aduiſe ye whether wee ſhall make a King or no. I know that Monſieur the Lieutenant would gladly bee he: ſo alſo would his nephew bee: and likewiſe his brother the Duke of Nemours: and I doubt not, but that the Dukes of Sauoy and of Lorraine haue as great deſire of it: for of a trueth they haue as much right to it one as another. Now concerning Duke Mercurie, his agents will doe as much for it as he himſelfe. If he had taken in good faith and earneſt Don Anthonio the King of Portugall,<note place="margin">Practiſe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend Don Anthonio.</note> and had deliuered him to his very good friend, the moſt Catholike King, as hee promiſed him, I beleeue that he would haue been content with the rights and claimes that hee hath to the Dutchie of Bretaigne, like vnto thoſe which his grandfather Iohn had by his wife. But here, he that is not he, taketh not he. Firſt of all, I counſell you not to ſtay your ſelues vpon the Duke of Sauoy, or vpon the Duke of Lorraine: for they are not (in ſpeaking with reuerence) but cods or bladders that haue enough to doe in their owne houſe: and I aſſure my ſelfe that they will be content with very little. If you wil leaue to the Savoyard, Daulphin &amp; Prouence, with ſome little part of Lionnois &amp; of Languedoc (yet ſo that you make him to take Geneua alſo) I would ingage my life that he will demaund no more of you,<note place="margin">If you can, or be able.</note> but the confiſcation of Eſdiguieres.<note place="margin">The name of a worthie man that holdeth him touch.</note> As touching the Duke of Lorraine, take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him the Dukedome of Bouillon, and giue him Sedan, Mets, all Champagne, and part of Bourgongne, which is for the good ſeating of him, you ſhall appeaſe him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for a morſell of bread, though it bee but browne. I come now vnto you Monſieur of Guiſe, the ſonne of a good father and of a good mother, one whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies haue of long time deſtined to kingdomes and empires, and haue ſurnamed you Pepin the ſhort, or cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talled. You, behold you, vpon the poynt to be another great Charles the great, your great great grandfather, if the fayre or market hold. But regard, I pray you, that you ſuffer not your ſelfe to bee deceiued. Theſe Meſſieurs of

They promiſe you this diuine damoſel or daughter in mariage, to make her a Queene <hi>in ſolidum,</hi> that is, altogether and wholly with you: but take you heede that the Duke de Feria haue not filled his ſeates ſigned without charge. He hath a boxe full of ſuch things, wherewith he ſerueth himſelfe vpon all occurrences, as of a laſt for euery ſhooe, and as one ſaddle for all horſes: he dates them, or he antedates them with his chamber pot when pleaſeth him. I haue feare, ſomething that he hath propounded vnto vs, that this is nothing but arte and ſubtiltie to amaze vs withal, when he hath ſeene that we will not vnderſtand, or be of minde to breake the law Salick. If you haue but neuer ſo little noſe, you ſhall ſmell it. For we knowe in good part, that the marriage is alreadie accorded of her and of her couſin the Archduke Erneſt. <hi>Adde,</hi> that is, ioyne hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that thoſe of the houſe of Auſtrich doe as the Iewes doe, that doe not marrie but in their tribe or familie, and hold one another by the tayle as hannekins and hanne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons doe.</p>

Lift not vp your traine for all this: we doe not inlarge or make longer your table by reaſon of this. There is hay: there are none but beaſts that delight in it: but doe better: obtaine of the holie father a croi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſade, or an expedition and voyage againſt the Turkes, and goe and reconquer that goodly kingdome of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, which appertaineth to you by reaſon of Godfrey, your great vncle, euen as wel as that of Sicilie and the kingdome of Naples. How many ſcepters and crownes are prepared for you, if your horoſcopus lie not, as you your ſelfe are wont to ſay, that you haue not a limited fortune. Leaue this ſame wretched and miſerable king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of France to him that will vouchſafe to take the burthen of it. It is not fit that your ſpirit borne for Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, and the vniuerſall monarchie of the habitable world, ſhould ſtoope to ſo ſmall morſels or matters, and vnworthie of you and of your late father,<note place="margin">A carefull caution.</note> whom God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue, if it be permitted to ſpeake ſo of Saints. And you Monſier the Lieutenant, to whom I muſt needes now ſpeake. What thinke you to doe? you are groſſe and fully panched: you are heauie and deformed: you haue head big enough in deede to beare a crowne. But what? you ſay you will none of it, and that it would too much ouer burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you. The politikes ſay, that the foxe ſayd ſo touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mulberies which he would faine haue had.<note place="margin">The foxe will eate no grapes.</note> You hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vnder ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that your nephew ſhuld not be choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: you forbid the deputies, that none of them bee ſo bold as to touch this great ſtring of the royaltie or kingdom.

For he looketh to himſelfe for all you, and hee diſtruſteth you both one and other, as though ye were blinde,<note place="margin">A iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and taketh you as theeues. In the meane while, yee haue prouoked the ſixteene, who accuſe you to bee a marchant of crownes, and haue offered this of Fraunce to him that would giue moſt. They make books of this to your preiudice, wherein they diſcipher all your actions. They ſay that you haue cloſe practiſes with the Biarnois, and cauſe wordes and meſſages to be caried vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by Villeroy and Zamet, to lull him a ſleepe, and to cauſe him to vnderſtand that you are a good French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and will neuer be a Spaniard, and that you can giue him Paris backe againe, and make peaceable vnto him all his kingdome, when hee ſhall haue been at Maſſe, and acknowledged our holy father, and vnder this baite and deceite, you haue drawne or gotten fortie thouſand politike crownes for three moneths, which indeede ſhould bee rated for foure,<note place="margin">A good arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metician.</note> euery one tenne thouſand crownes a peece, making you to vnderſtand that the Spaniſh King would pare and clip your diſtributions, if he knew that you treated concerning accord and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with heretikes. But it is diſcouered that ſecretly you ſend your agents to Rome and into Spaine, to lette that the Pope ſhould not giue him abſolution, if hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde it, and to ſtirre vp the King of Spayne, to ſend new forces towards the frontiers, you thinke you are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubtile: but your ſubtleties and fetches are ſowen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with white thred:<note place="margin">And therefore eaſilie diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> in fine, all the worlde ſeeth them.

You iuggle and deale craftily with all the world, and all the world doth deale ſo with you likewiſe. Danger there is that you become not that, that the Countie Saint Pol

As for being King of your head, looke not for it: your parte is periſhed, frozen, or runne into the fire: all your elders ſet themſelues againſt it Your couſines competitors, would rather goe and departe to the other ſides, than to indure it, the ſixteene make no more account of you, for they ſay that they haue made you that that you are, and you hang them vp and diminiſh their number as much as you can, the people had hope vpon your word, that you would vnlock and open the riuer, and make the wares and trade free: but they ſee to the contrarie, that they are more locked vp and ſtraitned than before, and that the bread and the ſmall good they haue to liue of, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not thorow your well dooing nor by your valour, but of the liberalitie of the Biarnois, and of his good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or of the couetouſnes of the getters of it, which drawe out of it all the profit. Briefelie, the greater parte beleeueth that you will prolong as long as you can, the Lieutenancie, in the which men haue placed you, and liue alwaies in warre and in trouble, and yet well to your eaſe, well ſerued, well intreated, well guarded of the Swiſſers and of the Archers, that there lacketh nothing, but the coates of armes, and the applauſe of the people to be King, whileſt all the reſt of the people dieth ſtarke mad through famine.

Moreouer though we ſhould haue choſen you King, yet you ſhould haue to doe with the Biarnois, who knoweth a thouſand feates or prankes of Baſque, and who ſleepeth not but as much as he will, and at the houre that hee will, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelfe a catholike, as he threatneth you hee will doe, will drawe on his ſide all the potentates of Italie, and of Almaine, and withall, the heart of all the French gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or gentlemen of France: of which you ſee alreadie the greateſt parte, with ſo many poore afflicted townes, wearie of their warre and of their pouertie, part to ſhake in the haft, and to make a writing of their retraict, that demaunde nothing elſe but that colour and good occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to withdrawe themſelues from the couple, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to couer or colour their repentance. Doe you dreame thereof, Monſieur the Lieutenant for the like you haue counterfeited the King, and yee haue farted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, or like the Biarnois, in edicts and declarations, in ſeales, in guardes, and great prouoſts, and maſters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of your houſe. Though you would burſt, and would blow vp your ſelfe, great as an oxe, as doth the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male frogge, yet ſhall you neuer be ſo great a Lord as he, although ſome ſay, that he hath not ſo much fat vpon all his bodie, as is able to feede a larke. But doe you knowe what you doe?

You will not demaund of me neither fidelitie nor
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:4210:42"/> oath for this matter, but I am of this aduiſe. I will not ſpeake here of Monſieur of Nemours, your <hi>vterin</hi> (but the politikes ſay <hi>adulterin</hi>) brother:<note place="margin">Speake clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for ſhame.</note> he hath done his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca or needes in our little cheſts: he hath his purpoſes and attemptes by himſelfe, and is like to Picrocolus, that by diſcourſes well reaſoned of, made himſelfe Monarch of the world, foote by foote. If he can gouerne the King of beaſts, as hee hath done the ſhippe of Paris, I will ſay that he hath skill to doe more, than Maſter Mouſche, or flie. Theſe beaſtes forget ſome times their gouernours, ſpeciallie if they change their habite or attire: hee ſhall not bee ill parted with, if hee come to his pretentions, whereto you Monſieur the Lieutenant, and Monſieur of Lyons will doe him, I beleeue, very good offices. The whole ſumme, Meſſieurs, you are too many dogges to gnawe one boane: you are iealous and enuious one of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and you can neuer tell how to agree, or liue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warre, that would put vs into worſe eſtate than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But I will tell you: let vs doe,<note place="margin">Deepe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell.</note> as they haue done in the conſiſtorie, for the election or choyſe of a holy father: when two Cardinals ſued and laboured for the pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the other Cardinals, for feare they ſhould incurre the hatred of the one or of the other, choſe one amongſt themſelues, the weakeſt backed of them all, and made him Pope. Let vs doe ſo, you are foure or fiue robbers in the realme, all great Princes, and ſuch as haue no want of appetite and ſtomacke. I am of aduiſe, that not one of you ſhould be king: wherefore I giue my voyce to Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot Fagotin, the keeper of Gentilly, a good vine dreſſer, and an honeſt man, who ſingeth well at the deske, and knoweth all his office or ſeruice booke by heart.<note place="margin">A worthie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</note> This will not be found without example, in ſuch times as this is: witneſſe the Harelle of Roane, where they made king one named le Graſſe, or the fatte, one as wee would ſay, who was much worſe aduiſed than Guillot. And thus you ſee whereupon I founde and grounde mine aduiſe. I haue read ſometimes the great and diuine Philoſopher
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:4210:43"/> Plato, who ſaith, that thoſe realmes are happie, where Philoſophers are kings, and where kings are Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. Now I know that it is little more than three yeares ſince that this good gardian of Gentilly and his familie, together with his kine meditated day and night Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, in a hall of our colledge, in which there is more than two hundred good yeares, that men haue read and treated, and diſputed publikely, philoſophie, and all Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,<note place="margin">The place ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth the perſon with theſe men, in all matters.</note> and all ſortes of good morall bookes. It is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that this good man hauing raued, ſlumbred and ſlept, ſo many dayes and nights, within theſe philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call walles, where there haue been made ſo many skill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full leſſons and diſputes, and ſo many goodly wordes vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, that there ſhould not ſomething thereof abide, that hath entred, pierced and penetrated into his braine, as it did to the poet Heſiodus, when hee had ſlept vpon mount Parnaſſus. And this is the cauſe why I perſiſt and meane, that he may as well be king as another.</p>
               <p>Now as Monſieur Roze ended theſe wordes, there ſprong out a great murmuring amongſt the deputies, ſome approuing, other ſome reprouing his opinion, and the princes and the princeſſes were ſeene, to whiſper in the eare one of another: yea it was hard that Monſieur the Lieutenant ſaide very baſely to the Legate, this foole here will marre all our miſterie.<note place="margin">A propheſie and no lie.</note> Notwithſtanding, the foreſaid Roze would haue continued his ſpeech: but when hee ſawe the noyſe to begin againe, with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine generall clacking of hands, he roſe vp in choler, and cried with a very loude and outſtretched voyce. How now, Meſſieurs? Is it permitted here to ſpeake what one thinketh? Haue not I libertie to ſpeake and conclude my arguments, as Monſieur of Lyon hath done? I know well that if I had been a courtier as he, I ſhould not haue named a perſon: for he hath charge from the clergie, to name Countie du Bouchage, Frier Angell, for the hope that this Prince louing change, would change alſo our miſeries, into ſtroakes or blowes from heauen. But I pray
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:4210:43"/> you keepe him to beare the golden torch in the battailes: for it ought to be enough for him, that he hath quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the bagge and the wallet. At theſe wordes euery one began againe to crie, to whiſtle, to hiſſe: and though the heraulds, the vſhers, porters and all cried aloude,<note place="margin">Huſh and be ſtill: the word peace is a bull-begger.</note> let euery man holde his tongue (not dating to ſpeake the worde peace there) and that Monſieur the Lieutenant ſundrie times commaunded them to make ſilence, yet it was not poſſible to appeaſe the bruite and noiſe, in ſo much that the ſayd Lord Rector, ſweate, fret, fomed, and ſtroke with his foote, and ſeeing that there was no more meane to take his theame againe, cryed as loude as hee could, Meſſieurs, Meſſieurs, I ſee well that you are in the Court of King Petault, where eueryone is maſter. I leaue it to you, and you to your ſelues: let another ſpeake: I haue ſpoken.</p>
               <p>And thereupon he ſet himſelfe downe againe, mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling very much, and wiping the ſweate from his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; and there ſcaped from him, as ſome ſay, certaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doriferant belchings of the ſtomacke, that ſmelled of the perfume of his choller, with certain words in a low note, complaining that they had defrauded the aſsignation ſent out of Spayne, for my maſters the Doctors,<note place="margin">Good ſtuffe: but there can come nothing els from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> and that others had made their profite of it, but that this was the gold of Tholouze, which ſhould coſt them very dearely. At the laſt, the rumour beginning a little to bee reappea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, Monſieur du Rieu the younger, Countie and gardien or keeper of Pierre-font, deputie for the Nobilitie of France, apparrelled with a little cape, after the Spaniſh faſhion, and a certaine high coppin tancked hat, lifted vp himſelfe to ſpeake, and hauing twiſe or thriſe put his hand to his throate, which did itch, he began in forme following.</p>

This in the whole is the matter, that wee muſt goe ſacke theſe ſame furred hoods of the court of Parliament, that play the galants, and meddle with the affaires of the eſtate where they haue nothing to doe, but to ſee and behold. O that you would giue them me but a little to manage: neuer did Buſsie the clerke doe his worke ſo well. If Monſieur the Legate commaund me only to goe to them, and put my hand on their necke or breaſt, there is not either ſquare cappe or hood, that I will not make flye about, if they heare mine eares ouer much, yea to this Monſieur Maiſtre, and to this du Vayr, that ſet all the reſt in traine.

But for this matter, I referre my ſelfe to Monſieur the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:4210:46"/> Lieutenant, who hath good skill to breake the ſtroake, and to tricke his couſins beard, yea and ſhaue it to, and that without a razor. Furthermore, if you muſt needes chuſe a King, I pray you thinke vpon me and my merits.

I tell you I am more then all theſe: for my grandfather was a ferrier in France, or of France: and if he got hell, I ſhall gaine paradiſe. Conſider I beſeech you Monſieur de S.

By this reckoning you may well make me King, and ſo you ſhall doe well: for if you doe, I will let you doe all you would.

Their firſt falling out was for the eſtate of great Maſter, which the King had giuen to Monſieur your father, when he made Monſieur of Montmorency Conſtable, who had been great Maſter before, and who had the Kings promiſe, that the ſayd eſtate ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued for his ſonne. Another cauſe of their ill husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie, or bad carriage of themſelues, was the Countie de Dampmartin, which both of them had gotten after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſorts:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sum ego mihi metipſi proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus:</hi> I loue my ſelfe beſt.</note> and being entred into ſuite about the ſame, Monſieur the Conſtable got it by an arreſt or decree. This did ſo alter and chaunge them, that either of them indeuored to caſt his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion out of the ſaddle, or as we ſay, to ſet him beſide the cuſhion. And from thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the voyage, that Monſieur your father made into
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:4210:51"/> Italie, where he did no great matter, becauſe that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Conſtable (who cauſed him to bee ſent thither, that ſo he might the more quietly, wholly and alone poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe the King) it may be hindred, or ſlacked the affayres: but he remained not long vnpuniſhed for it: for he was taken afterwards on S. Laurence day, while your father was abſent, who being returned, did by a certaine good happe, and the ſame indeed very wonderfull,<note place="margin">It was well done of the Guiſe to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come euil with well doing.</note> take againe the townes of Picardie (which wee had loſt) and Calais beſides. And that he might the better reuenge himſelfe of the euill dueties that he knew were done againſt him in his voyage, cauſed alſo the impriſonment of Monſieur the Conſtable to bee prolonged, and forgot no arte that might hinder or delay his deliuerance, which gaue an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to my Lords of Chaſtillon, to deſire the ayde, and to caſt themſelues into the armes and protection of the King of Nauarre, this Kings father, and of Monſieur the Prince of Conde his brother, who had married their neece. Alſo theſe two great houſes fell into factions and partakings, which were yet ſtirred vp and incenſed by the contention begun betweene the Prince of Conde, &amp; Monſieur d'Aumale your vncle, for the office of the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of the light horſe: there was as yet no me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or Huguenots.

But the trueth is, that when my Lords of Chaſtillon, very couragious men, and not able to indure the iniuries offered them, ſaw that the fauour of your houſe did ouertoppe theirs, and that they had not any meane to finde credite and fauour about the King, by reaſon of the lets that they of your race &amp; houſe caſt in the way, they were counſelled to withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from the Court, and as they were in their retraite, they ſhewed themſelues (but whether it were in good
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:4210:52"/> earneſt, or of policie and prudence I know not) to fauour the new Lutherans, who till then preached no where but in caues and dennes, and by little and little ioyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with them in faction and intelligence,<note place="margin">It is not good to fall into the clawes and pawes of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable men.</note> the rather to defend and keepe themſelues from your father &amp; your vncle, then to attempt any ſtirring or bringing in of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueltie, except then when the King, at the prouocation of your vncle (who had made the Pope to write vnto him thereabout) did himſelfe take Monſieur d'Andelot at Crecy, and ſent him priſoner to Melun. After this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, and that alſo of the Vidame of Chartres, and of certaine counſellors of parliament, fell out the violent and miraculous death of the King,<note place="margin">Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked riſe vp, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</note> which exalted your houſe to the ſoueraigne degree of power, neere about the young King Francis: and on the other ſide, did abate and almoſt altogether beate downe the houſe of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Conſtable, and of all thoſe that did belong vnto him. And this was then when his kindred (voyde of all hope of ordinarie meanes, becauſe that all was executed vnder the fauour of your allies) ioyned themſelues in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete intelligence with the Lutherans here and there ſcattered in diuers corners of the kingdom. And though they had as yet but little credit with them, as who were people vnknowne vnto them, and had not partaked, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Supper, nor in Synode, or Conſiſtorie, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding by the meanes of their agents, well skilled and practiſed in ſecrets, they made that memorable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe of Amboyſe, and aſſembled from all the quarters of the world,<note place="margin">

But theſe good people could not keep themſelues from trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, whereupon followed the execution done at Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boiſe, which diſcouered alſo the authors of the faction. And thereupon inſued the rigorous commaundement which they gaue to the King of Nauarre, and the impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:4210:52"/> of Monſieur the Prince of Conde in the eſtates at Orleans, and ſundrie other heauie accidents too long now to recite:<note place="margin">Mens malice ouerthrowne when God will.</note> which had continued and increaſed farre worſe, if the ſodaine death of the young King had not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the courſe, and broken the blow, which ſome went about to cauſe to light vpon theſe chiefeſt princes of the bloud royall, and vpon the familie of Monſieur the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, and of the Chaſtillons. A man may eaſily iudge, how much your houſe was ſhaken and toſſed, as it were by this vnlooked for death: and you may beleeue (Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Lieutenant) that Monſieur your father, and Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieurs your vncles played all at one time, at one kinde of game or bluſhing,<note place="margin">A fit compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon.</note> as you might do if a man ſhould bring you newes of the death of your two brethren. But they loſt not their courage no more then you doe: and had afterwards very good counſels and conſolations from the King of Spayne (of whom we will ſpeake by and by) who during theſe firſt diſſentions was vpon the skoutes, and watched to whom hee might offer his fauour, and how he might blow and ſtirre the fire, on the one ſide &amp; on the other, to make it to increaſe to that power and greatnes, in which we haue ſeene it,<note place="margin">Holy purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for ſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike a prince.</note> and doe yet now ſee it burne and conſume all France, which is the finall but of his pretenſions. Vpon hope then of the ſupport of ſo great a prince, which would not ſpare to promiſe men &amp; money, your father without being aſtoniſhed with ſo lumpiſh a fall, perceiuing the King of Nauarre to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in his ranke of the firſt prince of the bloud, for the ſauegard of young king Charles, and Monſieur the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable put in his charge or office againe, knew ſo well &amp; rightly to play his ball, that he practiſed them both, and drew them to his lure, againſt their owne brethren,<note place="margin">The recouerie of Nauarre &amp; ſome ſuch conceits.</note> and againſt their owne kinſmen: feeding one of them with a hope that I dare not ſpeake of, and flattering the other by ſubmiſſions and honors, that he beſtowed vpon him. And this he did ſo artificially and wel, that entring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into the paths and waies that he had forſaken, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:4210:53"/> taking his old aduantage, after that Monſieur the Prince of Conde was ſet at libertie (who had fairely preuented him but two or three daies onely) he went with a number of men of warre, and in great troupes, to ſeize the young King and the Queene his mother at Fountainebleau, &amp; brought them to Melun. And this was then when my ſayd Lord the Prince, and Meſſieurs of Chaſtillon, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing themſelues, neither by their head, nor by their houſes, ſtrong enough to reſiſt ſo puiſſant enemies, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with kingly authoritie and power, became Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans at one clap, and declared themſelues to be heads &amp; protectors of the new heretikes, whom they called to their ſuccour, and by their meanes did in open warre ſeaze and take many great townes of the kingdome, without making yet any mention of their religion, but onely for the defence of the King and of his mother, and to deliuer them out of the captiuitie &amp; bondage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Monſieur your father held them. And you Monſieur Lieutenant know, that theſe people alwaies boaſted, that what they did as in this behalfe, it was at the requeſt and commandement of the Queene Mother, whoſe letters written and ſent by her to them for that purpoſe, they haue cauſed to be publiſhed and imprinted. You are not ignorant of that which paſſed in this warre, and how af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the King of Spayne ſent your father ſuccour, but yet the ſame ſuch,<note place="margin">Fit fellowes to fight a field.</note> as I am aſhamed to ſpeake of it: al labourers and handicrafts men, gathered together, who would neuer fight at the battaile of Dreux, but couered themſelues with the wagons and carriages appoynted for the baggage.

But afterwards the diuers changings and alterations of our affayres, did indeed offer vnto the Spanyard another ſport. For your father being dead, and peace being made, knowing notwithſtanding theſe

Monſieur your vncle,<note place="margin">Cardinall of Lorraine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</note> being (as he was indeed) wittie, and pleaſing whom he would, had skill in ſuch ſort to gaine the heart of the Queene Mother, and the Queene Mother the heart of the King her ſonne, that he perſwaded them, ſpecially the Queene mother, that Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieurs the Princes of Bourbon, ayded by them of Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency and Chaſtillon, ſought nothing but her ruine, and would neuer bee quiet or leaue off, till they had dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen her out of the realme, and ſent her into Italie to her kinſfolkes.

To which poynt Meſſieur your vncle, did very nimbly put his hand, and valiantly puſhed or lifted at the wheele, that ſo he might put fire in the head of that young King Charles: without whoſe death wee neede not doubt, but that he had had the like ſcorne, that Monſieur the Mareſchall of Montmorency gaue him and Monſieur your brother in this towne, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he made them do all in their breeches,<note place="margin">Doubtie Dukes, and very cleanly.</note> becauſe they bare weapons and armour forbidden them, without his paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and leaue.

Now let vs come to that which fell out
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:4210:54"/> afterwards, for it is time to ſpeak of you, and of Monſieur your brother, who began from that time forward to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in armes, and to walke in the footſteps and tracts of your predeceſſors.<note place="margin">A fardle of frumps againſt Duke du Mayenne.</note> You haue alreadie cauſed your va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and valiances to appeare in the ſiege of Poictiers, which you brauely defended, contrarie to the aduiſe of the firſt husband of Madame la Lieutenant, Monſieur of Montpezat, your predeceſſor, who counſelled you to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all, and to get you packing thence. Afterwards you were at the battaile of Montcontour: and after that, at the iourney or exployt done vpon S. Bartholomews day: where the companions on the other ſide were taken napping, if not on ſleepe, and prouoked to ſay, whence come you.<note place="margin">Cardinall of Lorraine.</note> And though Monſieur your vncle at that time was turning ouer his portuiſe in Italie, yet the play was not performed without his intermedling, and ſeeking to haue the King of Spaynes approbation of it, &amp; the Popes abſolution, touching the marriage, which ſeemed for a lure, and a trappe alſo to the Huguenots. Afterwards you continued your blowes at the ſiege of Rochel, where me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did perceiue, that he that is at this day the King of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre, and Monſieur your brother, were but one heart &amp; one ſoule:<note place="margin">Men may maske, but diſſimulation wil break out.</note> and their great puritie and familiaritie, ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ielouſie and ſuſpition in all the world. But we muſt come to the matter. When you ſawe that King Charles was dead, who otherwiſe did not loue you very much, &amp; had ſundrie times repeated the ſaying of the great King Francis,<note place="margin">For he had no cauſe ſo to do.</note> whereof he himſelfe had made theſe foure ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, now very rife and common in euery mans mouth.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>King Francis was no whit beguiled,</l>
                  <l>When he foretold that the Guiſian race</l>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A ſteppe to the ſcepter as they thought.</note>When you ſaw him, I ſay dead without children, and the late King his brother married with your barren and vnfruitfull couſin, you began (Monſieur your brother and you I meane) to attempt and aſſay many practiſes and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:4210:54"/> plots, which many people ſayd were the cauſe of all our miſeries. I am not of that number which beleeue that Meſſieurs your father and vncle, had from their time layd the foundation of the building that your brother &amp; you haue builded ſince, though there bee that ſpeake of the notes of Dauid and of Piles, who haue better then No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtradamus prognoſticated &amp; foretold all that which we haue ſeene ſince their death: and though ſome aſſure vs, that Monſieur your vncle,<note place="margin">Cardinall of Lorraine.</note> had framed a certaine forme of all the order that was to beheld therein. But I cannot beleeue, that he that had as much vnderſtanding as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could haue, could hope to make his nephewes kings of France, ſeeing as yet three brethren, children of the Kings houſe in the right line, all of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very puiſſant, and in the floure of their age, readie to be married; and he could not diuine or geſſe, that they ſhould dye without iſſue, as they did afterwards. Beſides, hee ſawe a great number of the Princes of the royall bloud, that kept not themſelues warme with the robe of heretikes; that ſhould haue cut off all hope from his deſires. I knowe very well that in his time, he was the author that the Archdeacon of Thoul writ this much, that thoſe of the houſe of Lorraine were deſcended from Charles the great, by the males,<note place="margin">A pedigree publiſhed, but to ſmall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</note> that is to ſay, of Charles Duke of Lorraine, to whom the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome appertained, after the death of Lewes the fifth king of France: and that Hugh Capet hauing taken him at Laon, and brought him and his wife priſoner to Orleans, he had a ſonne or male child, of whom he affirmed the Dukes of Lorraine are deſcended: this was vnder hand caſt amongſt the people,<note place="margin">As all did well perceiue.</note> and you were neuer a whit grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with it, though that the common and true hiſtories doe plainly enough ſhew and witneſſe, that there was an interruption &amp; breaking off of males in the race of Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine, by two women, and namely in the wife of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey of Bouillon, named Idain. So the ſayd Archdeacon made an honourable amends for it,<note place="margin">A worthie Archdeacon.</note> according to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and ſentence giuen againſt him, and like a lewd fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:4210:55"/> and ſloathfull, or fainthearted man, vnſayd that he had ſpoken. But in fine, there was ſmall appearance, that at that time my ſayd Lord your vncle could aſpire to the kingdome, hauing ſo many hinderances and heads, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to fight againſt,<note place="margin">Two worthie waies to work by.</note> or to cauſe to dye by the ſword, or by poyſon. It is very true, that euen from his beginning, he was very ambitious and deſirous of greatnes, and of the gouernment of the ſtate, more then any other of his age: and I make no doubt of it, but that he deſired to poſſeſſe the Kings, and to haue held them, had hee been able, in tutorſhip and vnder gouernment, as in olde time the Maiors of the palace did, that ſo he might diſpoſe of all according to his pleaſure, and ſet vp or pull downe thoſe whom hee had liſted:<note place="margin">Wicked mens purpoſes and practiſes are vaine.</note> which is the thing whereto commonly the greateſt aſpire Notwithſtanding, being almoſt come thereunto, while he was liuing, he gathered together and prepared for you the materiall ſtuffe, with which you haue built this proued attempt, with your foot to hold the crowne of France, hauing left in your hand, firſt great riches, great eſtates, the chiefe offices &amp; char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the kingdome, great gouernments, many ſouldiers bound by good turnes done them, many ſeruants alſo, great intelligences with the Pope &amp; the King of Spayne, and other Princes your kinsfolkes and allies: and which is more, a great opinion amongſt the common people, that you were good Catholikes and ſworne enemies to the Huguenots. You knew very well how to make great profite to your ſelues by theſe preparations, and ſundrie ſorts of ſtuffe, which ye found after his death, all readie to bring vnto the worke. When I ſay you, I meane your ſelf brethren and couſins. After King Charles his death, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things ſucceeded well to you one after another,<note place="margin">Diuers deuiſes to ſtrengthen the Guiſian faction.</note> and to very good purpoſe. Firſt the barrennes of the King, or of your couſin his wife: then the retraite and abſence of the King of Nauarre, of which you were in part a cauſe, for the diſtruſts into which you brought him: and after that the diuiſion and diſſention between the King and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur

Another thing wherewith you thought to ſtrengthen your ſelues well, was the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance that Meſſieurs the Princes of Conty and of Soyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yeelded for a time to the King of Nauarre their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin germane, when they ſawe that the things you went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, were directly againſt all their familie, and that you boaſted you would ſupplant or vndermine them: for thereupon you vndertooke the matter, which you haue neuer ſince forſaken or forgotten, namely, to cauſe to be comprehended by and vnder the Popes bull,<note place="margin">If Spayne play not a part in this pageant, nothing can be done.</note> and by oths and proteſtations of the King of Spayne, neuer to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue hereticall princes, nor the children of heretikes, and then ye found out and firſt deuiſed theſe goodly names of adherents and fautors of heretikes. After all this, ye made your practiſes with the King of Spayne more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, and aſſured your conditions, and couenanted then for your penſions, promiſing him the kingdome of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre &amp; Bern for his ſhare, with the townes that ſhould ſerue his turne in Picardie and Champagne, and ye com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned with him concerning the meanes, that you would vſe to get hold of the eſtate. And the pretext that ye pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended thereto, was the wicked gouernment of the king,<note place="margin">Good pretexts to countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce a bad cauſe.</note> the prodigalities which he beſtowed vpon his two mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, Eſperon and Mercurie, whereof you drew one to your owne line, which was thought neuer a whit the better. You imployed all your diligence to make the poore prince odious to his people: you counſelled him to raiſe the taxes, to inuent new impoſts, to create newe officers, by which you your ſelues profited: for ſome did maintaine to Monſieur your brother at Chartres, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the barricades, that he had receiued halfe the money of three edicts made to fill the purſe, and which alſo were very pernicious or hurtfull,<note place="margin">Fine deuiſes to ſhred him of his king<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And this was then that you conceiued the kingdome preſent almoſt (euen as the appetite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth many times by eating) when you ſawe King Henry without hope of iſſue, the chiefe Princes accounted for heretikes,<note place="margin">He muſt needs goe that the diuell driueth.</note> or fautors of heretikes, the Conſiſtorie of Rome to lay the raines or bridle in your necke, and the King of Spayne to giue you the ſpurre. You had no more to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you, but the late Monſieur, who was a ſhrewd hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low dreamer, and who vnderſtood well with what wood you warmed your ſelues. He muſt be diſpatched out of the way: and Salcede his teſtament diſcouered vnto vs the meanes of it:<note place="margin">Who can ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d againſt ſuch deadly atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pts.</note> but force preuailing not, poyſon did the deede. All your ſeruants foretold this his death more then three moneths before it came to paſſe. Afterwards ye made no more ſmall mouths, or ſpake cloſely for the diſſembling of your purpoſe: you went no more cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping as cunnies, nor in ſecret: but you plainly layd open your ſelues. And yet notwithſtanding the better to ſet forward your affayres, you would make honeſt people beleeue, that this was for the publique benefite, and for the defence of the Catholique religion,<note place="margin">Catholike re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligion a fayre pretext.</note> which is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text and cloake that ſeditious perſons and ſtirrers vp of nouelties, haue alwaies taken to couer themſelues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Into this inſenſible net you drew that good man Monſieur the Cardinall of Bourbon, a prince without malice, and ye were able ſo cunningly to turne and wind him, that yee ſeized him with a fooliſh and vndiſcreet ambition, that in the end ye might deale with him, as the cat doth with the mouſe, that is to ſay, after ye had plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon. No vntrue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> You drew thereunto ſundry Lordes of the Realme, diuers gentlemen and captaines, many cities, townes, and communalties: and amongſt others this miſerable citie, which ſuffered it ſelfe to bee taken as it were with birde lime, partly by reaſon of the hatred that they had againſt the miſdemeanours of the late King: partly alſo by reaſon of the impreſſion, which you put into them, that the Catholike religion would vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly be ouerthrowne, if the King did die without childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; the ſucceſſion of the kingdom ſhuld come to the King of Nauar, who called himſelf the firſt prince of the blood. Hereupon you forged &amp; framed your firſt declaration or manifeſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that had not in it ſo much as one only word of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but you did indeed demaund therein,<note place="margin">They will hardly agree with others that diſſent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> themſelues.</note> that al the ſtates, &amp; gouernments of this kingdome, ſhuld be taken from them that poſſeſſed them, and were not at your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, which eſcape you amended in your ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, by the counſell of Roſne, who (to the end hee might ſet al on a fire) ſaid, that there needed nothing elſe but the ſetting out of religion: and then you preached vnto vs, of a Synod at Montauban,<note place="margin">A fine deuiſe to foſter the fire of faction in Fraunce.</note> and of a diet in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie, where you ſaide that all the Huguenots of the worlde had plotted together, to ſeize the Kingdome of Fraunce, and to drawe the prieſts out of it. Some verily beleeued you, yea and I my ſelfe (who am not of the craftieſt) had ſome opinion thereof, and thereupon ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my ſelfe with this partie, for the feare that I alwaies had, to forgoe my religion: many good people did as my ſelfe, that are for all that in no better eſtate. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that demaunded nothing but newe hurlie burlies and ſtirres, made ſhew as though they did beleeue it.

Hauing thus plaied your part, and receiued many doublons or double duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets out of Spaine, you put your ſelues into the fieldes,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4210:57"/> with a very good and braue armie.<note place="margin">Whether it were or not the fact was euil.</note> Some ſay that this, was not done without the knowledge and conſent of Queene mother, who loued troubles, that ſhee might make her ſelfe neceſſary, and a perſon to be imployed in doing all thinges, whereunto ſhe was very apt and fitte. But as much Italicanated and craftie as ſhe was, yet ſhe was deceiued therein For at the firſt ſhe did not beleeue, that your deſſeignes and attempts did fly ſo high, and did not diſcouer the lampe or light, which brake out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what late after that you had ſet your foote ſo forwarde, that there was no more meane for you to retire, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not very likely, though ſhe had conceiued ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment againſt, and miſlike of her ſonne, (who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſuffered himſelfe to be gouerned rather by others, than by her) that ſhe would ſuffer him to fall,<note place="margin">Yet natural people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit vnnatural things.</note> and to ſee him depriued of the crowne, to eſtabliſh your brother therein, in whom ſhe truſted not but for faſhion ſake on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Wherefore the aide that that good Ladie yeelded you, was not to deſtroy her ſonne, but to bring him to humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and acknowledgment of his fault: which ſhe thinking ſhe had done by your meane, ſhe cauſed you afterwards to diſperſe your armie, which ſerued you for no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but to acquaint you with your forces, and to extort by violence,<note place="margin">Law againſt law.</note> this edict of Iulie, which did fruſtrate and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anull all the other edicts, made for pacification, and did yet once againe renew fire, fagot, ſlaughter, and all in Fraunce againſt the Huguenots.

And this was then when the Pariſiens began to perceiue, and ſee gueſts liuing at their owne diſcretion and pleaſure in their houſes, contrary to all the ancient priuiledges, granted them by the former Kings: but theſe were but little fleurets or filips, in compariſon of that which wee ſuffered afterwards, and yet notwithſtanding you ſuffered them to take euen before and vnder your noſe Eſtampes and Pontoiſe, without ſuccouring of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And you ſeeing that they returned vpon you, minding either to draw you foorth to the field, or to ſhut you vp within our walles, you I ſay did then well perceiue by the

But it is very evident, that before he went about this accurſed enterpriſe,<note place="margin">Sometimes it is not amiſſe to be a blabbe of a mans tongue.</note> you ſaw him, and I could well tell the places where, and the times when, if I would. You incouraged him: you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him Abbeyes, Biſhoprickes, mountaines and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes, and ye left the reſt to bee done to Madame your ſiſter, to the Ieſuits, and to the Prior of his order, who paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſome what further, &amp; promiſed him nothing leſſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a place in paradiſe aboue the Apoſtles, if it fell out that he were martyred. That it was ſo, &amp; that ye were very well aduertiſed of all the myſterie or ſecret, you cauſed the people, that ſpake of yeelding themſelues to be preached vnto and taught, that they would yet haue patience but ſeuen or eight daies,<note place="margin">Good reaſon: all lead by one murthering ſpirit.</note> and that before the ende of the weeke, they ſhould ſee ſome great matter, that ſhould ſet vs in our former reſt and quietnes. The preachers of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:4210:65"/> Roan, of Orleans, and of Amiens, preached it at the ſame time, and in the ſame tearmes. Afterwarde ſo ſoone as your Frier poſſeſſed with a diuell was departed, you cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bee arreſted and apprehended for priſoners in this citie, more than two hundred of the principall citizens and others, whom yee thought to haue goods &amp; friends, and to be of credit with them of the Kings ſide, as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution or forewarning, wherwith you purpoſed to ſerue your ſelues,<note place="margin">The name of ſome diuel, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying therby the murtherer Clement.</note> to redeeme that wicked Aſtaroth, in caſe he were either taken before the facte or after the facte. For hauing the pledge of ſo many honeſt men, you ſuppoſed that they durſt neuer put that murtherer to death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the threatning which yee had giuen out, that yee would cauſe to die in the way of change for him, thoſe whom you kept priſoners: who in truth are much bound to them, that in a headlong heate or choller, ſlewe with the blowes of their rapiers that wicked wretch, after hee had giuen his ſtroake. And you your ſelfe ought not leſſe to thanke them. For had they ſuffred him to liue (as they might haue done) and put him into the hands of iuſtice,<note place="margin">It is almoſt as wel diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red now.</note> we had had the whole thread of the enterpriſe, naturally and liuely deducted, and you had beene there incouched in white clothes, for a marke of your diſloyaltie and felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, that neuer would haue beene blotted out. But God did no ſo permit it, and we know not yet the end wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he keepeth you. For if the examples of former times doe carrie with them any conſequence,<note place="margin">A very large aſſertion, but yet for the moſt part true.</note> to iudge of the affaires of the time preſent, wee neuer ſawe yet vaſſall or ſubiecte, that enterpriſed to driue his Prince out of his kingdome, to die in his bed. I will not ſtrengthen this maxime or rule, by many hiſtories, nor reſute thoſe, which our preachers alledge, to defende and iuſtifie that horrible act. I will ſpeake of no more but two, the one out of the Bible, and the other out of the Romane hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. You haue heard it may be, ſome preach, that thoſe that ſlew Abſalom, though he were vp in armes againſt his father, his King, and his countrie, were notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

If you haue read the conflicts that were made between Galba, Otho, and Vitellius, for the Empire of Rome, you haue read &amp; found that Vitellius put to death, more then ſixe hundred men, who bragged that they had ſlaine Galba his predeceſſor, &amp; had preſented a petition to be recompenced therfore:<note place="margin">It may be he meaneth Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiuel.</note> which he did not, as ſaith the author (who at this day ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth inſteede of an Euangeliſt to many) for the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that he caried to Galba, nor for the honour that hee ment to doe him, but to teach all princes to aſſure their life and their preſent eſtate, and to cauſe them, that ſhuld dare to attempt any thing againſt their perſons, to know &amp; vnderſtand, that an other prince their ſucceſſor (though perhaps their enemie) after ſome one ſort or other would reueng their death. And this is the cauſe, wherefore you Monſieur the Lieutenant had great wrong, to make ſhew of ſo great ioy,<note place="margin">Woe to them that laugh now, for they ſhal weepe.</note> hauing knowne the newes of that cruell accident that befel him, by whoſe death you ſhould enter into the waies of the kingdome.

Or to haue done as Alexander the great, who cauſed ſumptuous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequies to bee made for Darius: or as Iulius Caeſar, who wept with hotte and bitter reares, vnderſtanding of the death of Pompey his competitor, and deadly aduerſary, and put them to death that had ſlaine him.<note place="margin">What could a man of a baſe and bad mind doe els?</note> But you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the practiſes of theſe great perſonages, did laugh, &amp; make feaſtes and bonfires, and all fortes of ioy, when you vnderſtoode of the cruell death of him, from whome you held all that you and your predeceſſors had or haue, of wealth, of honour, and of authoritie. And not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:4210:66"/> with theſe common reioycings, which did ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly witneſſe, how much you approued this accurſed acte, you cauſed the murtherers picture to be made, &amp; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it publikely abroad,<note place="margin">All this what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, is but the reward of iniquitie.</note> as if it had beene of a canonized ſaint. You cauſed his mother and kinred to be ſought out, that you might enrich them with publike almes, to the end that this might be a lure, and a baite for others, that would vndertake to giue yet ſuch an other blowe, to the King of Nauar, vnder hope &amp; aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which they might receiue by the example of this new martyr, that after their death, they ſhuld be ſo ſanctified, &amp; their kinred wel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>penſed. But I wil not further examine your conſcience, nor prognoſticate vnto you,<note place="margin">A plaine and true ſpeech.</note> that which may fall out vnto you for this fact.

But I will leaue this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the diuines to treate hereof, that ſo I may come to put you in minde of a great and ſtale faulte, which you committed at the very ſame time. For ſith you feared not in ſo many places to declare, that your ſpeciall marke was to raigne and be a King, you had then, and by reaſon of the blow, a good occaſion offered you to cauſe your ſelfe to be choſen King, and you might better then haue attayned thereto, than you can at this preſent, when you ſue,<note place="margin">Many deuiſes are in mans heart: but the Lords purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſhall ſtand for euer.</note> ride, runne, corrupt and all to get it. The Cardinall of Bourbon (to whom vnaduiſedly you gaue the title of the King) was a priſoner. Your nephew (vpon whome they did beſtowe all the commendations and glorie of his father) was ſo likewiſe, and neither the one nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could hurte you therein or hinder you, as your ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew doth at this day: you had yet the people harmed, earneſt and running after noueltie and change, who had a great opinion of your valour, from which you are much fallen ſince, and I make no doubt but that you had caried it away, thorow the hatred of the lawfull ſucceſſor, who
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:4210:66"/> was notoriouſlie knowne to be a Hugue not. And beſides, you had diuers preachers, who had laide out a thouſand reaſons to perſwade the people, that the Crowne did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long rather to you than to him.<note place="margin">Nay foule and falſe.</note> The occaſion for it was faire, namely, the changing of it from one line to another. And although it bee all but one familie, and of the ſame ſtalke, as we may ſay, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of more than ten degrees (in which the doctors ſay, there ceaſeth all the bond and right of conſanguinitie) made a goodly ſhew, although that Doctor Baldus hath written, that this rule faileth in the familie of the Bourbonians. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto adde, that you had the force and the fauour of the time in your hand, wherewith you could not ſerue your owne turne, or helpe your ſelfe, but rather, thorough a certaine fainthartednes, and very foule and groſſe cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardiſe, you would obſerue forſooth ſome little modeſtie, and forme of the ciuill lawe, giuing the title of the King to a poore prieſt that was a priſoner:<note place="margin">The Cardinall of Bourbon.</note> although that in all other things, you did ſhameleſlie violate all the lawes of the realme, and all lawe beſides of God and of man, whether it were naturall or ciuill.

We made warre againſt the Curats of S. Euſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius, and of S.

Ieruſalem put to death her King &amp; her annoynted one, of the race and ſtock of Dauid, &amp; cauſed him to be betraied by one of his diſciples, &amp; of his owne nation: Paris hath chaſed &amp; driuen away her prince, her king, her natural annointed one, &amp; afterwards cauſed him to be betraied &amp; murthered by one of her Friers. The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gaue the people to vnderſtand that their king had a diuel within him,<note place="margin">God will cut out &amp; deſtroy lying tongues: but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not that.</note> in whoſe name he wrought his miracles: Our preachers and doctors haue they not preached this vnto vs, that our late king was a ſorcerer, &amp; that he worſhipped the diuel, in whoſe name he did al his deuotions?

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:4210:70"/> to kill the King? and haue they not yet preached it after his death? Within Ieruſalem there were three factions, which cauſed themſelues to be called by diuerſe names, but the moſt wicked of them, called themſelues zealous, and were aſſiſted with the Idumeans that were ſtrangers. Paris hath been toſſed and vexed altogether in the ſelfe ſame ſorte, with three factions, that is of Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine, Spayne, and the ſixteene, participating of both the other two, vnder the ſame name of zealous, who haue their Eleazars,<note place="margin">A pretie alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet no illuſion.</note> and their Zacharies, &amp; Acaries, and more Iohns, than there were in Ieruſalem. Ieruſalem was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged by Titus, a Prince of diuers religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the Iewes, he going at that time to the hazards and dangers of the aſſault, as a ſimple ſouldier, and yet ſo gentle and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous was he, that he procured himſelfe thereby to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the delights of mankinde.

Ieruſalem ſuffered all extremitie, before it would acknowledge a fault, and acknowledging it, had no more power to redreſſe it, and was hindred from it by the heads of the faction. How much haue we ſuffered before we would know our ſelues? And ſince our ſufferings, how often haue we deſired, that wee might yeelde, if wee had not beene hindred therefrom by them that holde vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the yoke? Ieruſalem had the fort of Anthonia, the temple and the fort of Sion, that bridled the people, and let them that they could not ſtirre nor complaine. We haue the forte of S.

One thing indeede hee wanteth, which I coulde tell in the eare of ſome, if I liſted. I will not ſay it is his different religion from ours, which you ſo much vpbraide him with: for in ſome good meaſure we knowe,<note place="margin">No, GOD wrought not that work, but his owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</note> that God hath touched his heart, and that he is willing to be taught, and doth alreadie applie himſelfe to inſtruction, yea that he hath cauſed word to be ſent to the holy father, concerning his very nigh conuerſion: of which I make ſuch account, as if I had alreadie ſeene it, he hath alwaies ſhewed himſelfe to haue ſuch regarde of his promiſes, and to be ſo religious a keeper of his words.

Excommunication ſtretcheth not but vnto the ſoules, and not vnto mens bodies and goods. Innocent the third, exalting the moſt proudely that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly he could his popelike power, ſaid, that as God had made two great lights in the firmament, to wit the ſunne for the day, and the moone for the night, ſo hath he made two in the Church, the one for mens ſoules, which is the Pope, whom he compared to the ſunne, and the other for mens bodies, which is the King. Mens bodies enioye outward goods, and not their ſoules:<note place="margin">The right ende of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</note> excommunication therefore cannot take them away, for that is but a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine for the ſoule to heale it, and to bring it to health, and not for to kill it, it is not to condemne it, but to make it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide of damnation.

I woulde willingly demaunde when they haue taken the kingdome, and the crowne from a King, becauſe hee is excommunicate, or an heretike, whether then they muſt chooſe another, and put that other in his place, for it is not reaſonable that the people ſhoulde remaine without a King, as you Meſſieurs, would worthilie indeede prouide for it.<note place="margin">A queſtion not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Clemencie (in which he is aboundant and exceſſiue) is a very laudable virtue, and which bringeth in the ende very great fruites, and ſuch as will continue long, though that they be long and ſlow in comming Howbeit, it belongeth to none but to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours to vſe it, and to them that haue none to reſiſt them.<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For it ſeemeth that ſuch as ſpare their enemies, deſire that others ſhould practiſe as much towards them, and that they demaund recompence for their generoſitie: or els they feare, that if they ſhew themſelues ſeuere, that they can haue no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their other enemies, that reſt yet to be ſubdued. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſome name it very plainly, imbecilitie or weakenes of heart, ſuppoſing that he that dare not vſe his right, is not yet aſſured of victorie, but rather feareth that he ſhuld be ouercome. But the Philoſophers that haue intreated this poynt to the full or to the bottome and depth of it, haue not aſcribed it to virtue, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe that enterpriſed to trouble an eſtate, haue ſhewed themſelues gentle and courteous in the beginning of their attempts and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<note place="margin">A bad exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple.</note> as that gentlenes that Iulius Caeſar vſed towards the ſouldiers and citizens of Rome before that he was conquerour, was not clemencie but flatterie, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious curteſie, by which he would make himſelf accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the people,<note place="margin">A good ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence though not well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</note> and draw euery one to his ſide. And this is it that that great maſter of Eſtates ſayth, The fame of clemencie is profitable to ſuch as affect authoritie, or
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:4210:83"/> els vſurpe rule. For to ſuch as inuade a kingdome againſt right and lawe (as you Monſieur Lieutenant doe) the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count or reputation of being gentle and gracious, is of very great vſe. But this rather was Caeſars clemencie, that hauing ouercome Pompey, &amp; diſcomfited all that might reſiſt him, he came to Rome without triumph, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned all his deadly enemies, putting them all in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their goods, honors and dignities, of which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding there was but a bad iſſue to himward: for thoſe whom he had pardoned,<note place="margin">A foe well v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue a foe ſtill.</note> and ſhewed moſt fauours vnto, were they that betrayed him, and miſerably mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered him. Wherefore there is a difference betweene clemencie and gentlenes. Gentlenes ordinarily is to bee found in women, and in men of ſmall courage: but cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie is not in any but in him that is an abſolute maſter, and that doth good, when he is able to doe all manner of euill. Wherfore let vs conclude then, that our King ought to haue reſerued the vſe of his clemencie, till he had had vs all in his power. This is inclemencie, yea crueltie ſayth Cicero, to pardon them that deſerue to dye,<note place="margin">A good ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in reaſon and religion both.</note> and the ciuill warres ſhall neuer haue end, if we will hold on to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and ſhewe fauour, where ſeueritie of iuſtice is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie.

But notwithſtanding all the inquirie, that I was able to make thereabout, I could not finde a man, that told mee any very certaine and aſſured newes, touching
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:4210:96"/> the ſame, but ſpeaking only by preſumptions, ſuſpitions, and coniectures; till one of theſe dayes laſt paſt, when I was almoſt paſt hope, to knowe any thing touching the matter, there did by fortune come vnto me in the ſtreet, a very aged man, very leane alſo, and pale, which ſince I haue heard to bee called Maſter Polypragmon,<note place="margin">That is Maſter buſie bodie.</note> who ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly and vpon the ſodaine demaunded of me, if it were not I that had printed the Catholicon of Spaine. At the firſt I made ſome difficultie and doubt, to confeſſe it vnto him, fearing that hee had bin ſome one of them, that had bin named therein, and had felt himſelfe moued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, as diuers had done: no, no, ſaith he, keep not cloſe from me, that that all the world knoweth, I was at Yours when you firſt imprinted it, and knowe indeed the name of them, that gaue you the originall copie thereof: but for all that it may bee, that neither your ſelfe, not they which gaue you it, knewe who was the author thereof. Perceiuing then, that he knewe ſo much of this matter, I could not but confeſſe, that in trueth I had printed it at Tours, but that I was not able to finiſh it, but in the very time that I muſt truſte vp my baggage to come into this citie, after that the Pariſiens were returned to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer good vnderſtanding, and brought into the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the King. That fell out well for you, ſayd he, for before that you had ſet it abroad, diuers men had ſeene ſundrie imperfect, and defectiue copies, which had very much ſtirred vp their deſire, to ſee the reſt well poliſhed and publiſhed. But you are much out of the way, when in your Epiſtle ſet before the booke, you ſayd that it was an Italian that made it, at the aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly of the Eſtates of Paris. For I know very well the name of him that compoſed it, who alſo lodgeth not farre from hence. Whereupon I was very glad of this encountring, and I did very earneſtly pray him to name him vnto mee, at the leaſt wiſe, if it were lawfull for me to know him: becauſe that I had ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many thinges of great importance, to tell him for his benefit and honor. I will ſayd he, tell you his name, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:4210:96"/> wil alſo ſhewe you his lodging, vpon condition, that you will not diſcloſe it to any man, for he is a perſon that doth not loue to be ſo much viſited, as many doe now a daies. Thoſe that told you that hee was of Italie, were deceiued by one letter only, he is not of Italie, but of Alethie,<note place="margin">That is, Truth.</note> which is farre differing from the other:<note place="margin">That is, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. That is, Free ſpeakers. That is, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of mony. That is, Deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of honor. That is, Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne. That is, a hater of gardens.</note> and he was borne in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle towne, that men call Eleuthere, inhabited heretofore and built by the Parreſiens, who haue continual warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Argyrophiles, &amp; Timomanes, a very puiſſant &amp; populous natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. His name is the Lord Agnoſſe, of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie and ſtocke of Miſoquenes, a gentleman of good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and no deceiuer, which loueth the counſell of wine better, than the councell of Trent. You ſhall know him by this, that he is alwaies attired after one maner, and neuer changeth his apparell or garments, as if hee had nothing els but to thinke vpon, and to gouerne Lions. Hee is a great little man, that hath his noſe between both his eies, his teeth in his mouth, his beard vpon his chinne, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly wipeth his mouth, and his noſe vpon his ſleeues. You ſhall find him at this preſent, lodged in the ſtreete of Good time, at the ſigne of the Rich labourer, and he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth very often to walke in the blacke Friers, becauſe hee loueth them very well. And hereupon I recommend me vnto you, for I haue to deale in other places, by reaſon of certaine packets that are come from Rome, which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure vs, that our abſolution hangeth by no more, but a twiſted thread at this time of the yeere. As hee had very brutiſhly &amp; thickly ſpoken theſe words, he went his way, and left me yet in ſuſpence, notwithſtanding I was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what better ſatisfied, than I was before, ſith I knewe the name, and the lodging place of mine author. And at the ſame time I went thorow all the quarters of Paris, and inquired of the ſtreet, and the ſigne that he had told me, but no newes were to bee found, neither of Good time, nor Rich labourer. In the daies following I did weare three paire of ſhoes, or there about, in ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning vp &amp; down the ſtreets, &amp; could learne nothing. To be brief, I had bin
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:4210:97"/> in the ſame ſtate ſtil; but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by hazard, I met with a certain honeſt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I had ſomtimes heard ſay, was a Parreſie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of whom I asked the ſame queſtion, which I had vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably made alreadie tenne thouſand times, and that to ſo many men. He told me that he had heard ſpeech of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine gentleman of Eleuthere, and of the familie of Miſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenes, but he knew not whether it were he that I asked for, becauſe that there were diuers of that name in Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie. I beſought him to guide me to the lodging of him whom he knew, which thing he did, and at the laſt, after many turnings and windings, thorowe ſundrie &amp; diuers little ſtreetes, he ſhewed me a little low doore, into which I entred without knocking, and found in a little high chamber, very pleaſant &amp; well furniſhed, a man of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſentation, leaning and reading vpon a booke, drawing very nigh to the cut and fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hion that that man maſter Pol had deſcribed vnto me. I demaunded of him (greeting and reuerence being preſuppoſed) whether he were the Lord Agnoſte Miſoquene: men indeede (ſayd he) call me Miſoquene, but I am not Agnoſte. He whom you inquire of, is indeede my very neere kinſman, and we are both two of one countrie, and of one towne, but it ſhall be very hard for you at this preſent to finde him: for his lodging is more hidden and ſecret, then the neaſt of a Tortoiſe. Notwithſtanding, if you would haue any thing with him, I can from hence at any time aduertiſe him thereof. Then ſayd I vnto him, Monſieur, I beleeue that it is he, that is the author of that little diſcourſe, that is made touching the holding and aſſemblie of the Eſtates of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, and of the Catholicon of Spayne, which he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, <hi>A Satyre Menippized.</hi> I haue heard him himſelfe thereof (ſayd he) ſay ſo. That is a worke (quoth I to him) which hath been very much receiued, and which I haue imprinted (for I am a Printer at your commaundement) without knowing the value thereof. Which may appeare by this, that at the beginning thereof at Tours, I printed but ſeuen or eight hundred copies, but ſo ſoone as it was
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:4210:97"/> ſeene at Paris (whither I brought it with my preſſes and moueable goods) the whole world thought it ſo beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſo well done, that men ranne vnto it as to a fire, in ſo much that I printed it foure times in three weekes, and I am readie now to print it the fift time, if I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred but onely one halfe houre with the author. After this, this honeſt man ſayd, I haue oftentimes heard my couſin ſay, that he was very much grieued, that this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie came into ſight, before he had reuewed the ſame, and cut off diuers things, which it may be, he thought eaſie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to paſſe then, when he compoſed the ſame: but in the time wherein we are, it may bee they may ingender ſome ſcandale, and offend ſome perſons of qualitie, who are named therein, or poynted out thereby. For thoſe which haue acknowledged and amended their faults, do very well deſerue, that men ſhould ſuppreſſe and burie the remembrance therof, rather then refreſh it, and make it perpetuall, by ſuch prouoking and merrie writings. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo I haue heard him complaine of a certaine booke ſeller, who either thorowe couetouſnes, or of iealouſie towards others, hath cauſed this worke to be printed in very ſmall letters, ill corrected, and very vnpleaſant: and who alſo hath been ſo raſh and headie, to take from it, and to put to it, whatſoeuer pleaſed himſelfe, which thing indeede iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ought not to indure. Notwithſtanding the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is publike, whereunto euery man may put additions, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch as reſpect the matter: for otherwiſe, or beſides that I know very well, that my ſayd couſin, neither wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, nor hopeth to haue honor or praiſe thereby. Then I demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of him, if there were not any meane for me to ſee the ſaid lord Agnoſte. And he anſwered me, that there was not any for that ſeaſon, becauſe that his ſayd couſin did ſometimes ſhut vp himſelfe for eight daies ſpace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, without ſeeing any man. But yet that if he had a mind to know any matter concerning his intent or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he thought he was able to ſatisfie me, euen aſwell as his couſin himſelfe, becauſe that they had oftentimes
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:4210:98"/> diſcourſed together, touching this matter, as alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this, that ſome came vnto him euery day to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port vnto him the ſpeeches which men vſed in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and thorow out the citie touching his booke. I will therefore bee bold, ſeeing that I cannot haue this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to behold him, euen I, I ſay, will be bold, to demand of you ſome doubts, whereat I ſee ſundry men to ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and not to be able well to reſolue themſelues. Firſt, wherefore did he affect this new title of Satyre Menippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, which all the world vnderſtandeth not, ſeeing that in the written copies, it had this inſcription, The abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſoule of the Eſtates. This queſtion (ſayd hee) cannot fall but in ignorant ſpirits, for all they which haue bin brought vp in learning, knowe very well, that this word Satyre, doth not only ſignifie a poeſie, containing euill ſpeech in it, for the reproofe, either of publike vices, or of particular faults of ſome certaine perſons, of which ſort are thoſe of Lucilius, Horace, Iuuenal, and Perſius: but alſo all ſortes of writinges, repleniſhed with ſundry matters, and diuers argumentes, hauing proſe and verſe intermixed or mingled therewithall, as if it were pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred neats tongues interlarded. Varro ſaith, that in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times, men called by this name, a certaine ſorte of pie or of pudding, into which men put diuers kindes of hearbes, and of meates. But I ſuppoſe that the word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from the Graecians, who at their publike and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne feaſtes, did bring in vpon their ſtages or ſcaffolds, certaine perſons diſguiſed, like vnto Satyres, whom the people ſuppoſed to be halfe Gods, full of laſines, &amp; wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnes in the woods, euen ſuch a one, as preſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe aliue vnto Sylla, and ſuch a one of them as Saint Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome rehearſeth, appeared vnto Saint Anthonie. And theſe men diſguiſed after this manner, being naked and tattered, took a certaine kind of libertie vnto themſelues, to nippe and to floute at all the worlde, without puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In olde time, ſome made them to rehearſe their iniurious verſes all alone, without any other matter in
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:4210:98"/> them, then railing and ſpeaking euill of eueryone, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men mingled them with Comedie players, who brought them into their acts, to make the people laugh: at the laſt, the more graue and ſerious Romanes chaſed them altogether out of their Theaters, and receiued in their place, Vices in playes: but the more wiſe and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Poets vſed them, to content therewithall, their owne bad ſpirit of euill ſpeaking, which ſome of them thought to bee the chiefe goodnes. And there are great numbers of them found in our countrie of Parreſie, who loue ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to loſe a good friend, then a good word or a merrie ieſt, applied well to the purpoſe. Wherfore it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, that they haue intituled this little diſcourſe, by the name <hi>Satyre,</hi> though that it be written in proſe, being yet notwithſtanding ſtuffed and ſtored with gallant Iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, pricking notwithſtanding and biting the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the conſciences of them, that feele themſelues nipped therewithall, concerning whom it ſpeaketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but trueth: but on the other ſide, making thoſe to burſt with laughter, that haue innocent hearts, and are well aſſured that they haue not ſtrayed from the good &amp; right way. As concerning the adiectiue <hi>Menippized,</hi> it is not new or vnuſuall, for it is more then ſixteene hundred yeares agoe, that Varro called by Quintillian, and by S. Auguſtine, the moſt skilfull amongſt the Romanes, made Satyres of this name alſo, which Macrobius ſayth were called Cyniquized, and Menippized: to which he gaue that name becauſe of Menippus the Cynicall Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, who alſo had made the like before him, al ful of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ieſtings, &amp; poudred merie conceits of good words, to make men to laugh, and to diſcouer the vicious me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his time. And Varro imitating him, did the like in proſe, as ſince his time there hath done the like, Petronius Arbiter, &amp; Lucia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Greek tongue, &amp; ſince his time Apuleius, and in our age that good fellow R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>belaiz, who hath paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all other men in contradicting others, and pleaſant conceits, if hee would cut off from them ſome quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libetarie
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:4210:99"/> ſpeeches in tauernes, and his ſalt and biting words in alehouſes. Wherefore I cannot tell what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men theſe daintie ones are, that thinke ſome doe euill, that according to the example of theſe great perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, ment to giue vnto a like worke, a like title vnto that of theirs, which is now become common, and as we ſay, appellatiue, whereas before it was proper and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: as not long time ſince, a learned Flemming and a good Antiquarian, hath vſed the ſame. And this is al that I can tell you in this reſpect. If you deſire any other thing, I will tell you my aduiſe or opinion. Then ſayd I vnto him, I am ſufficiently ſatisfied as touching the title; but there is very great diſputation amongſt ſome, what the author ſhould meane by theſe tearmes, <hi>Higuiero of hell:</hi> for there are very many perſons that knowe not what it meaneth, and make thereof ſundrie horned and ill fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red interpretations, ſuch as in my minde the author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe neuer thought of. I knowe very well (ſayd he) that there are diuers that deſire to play about the affinitie of the words: ſome, to make themſelues merrie therewith: and others to draw the author into enuie: but there is much oddes betweene eight and eighteene, and a great difference betweene breathing and whiſtling. I haue heard my couſin a hundred times ſay, and I knowe it alſo as well as hee, that <hi>Higuiero of hell,</hi> ſignifieth no other thing in the Caſtillian or Spaniſh tongue, but the Figge tree of hell. For the Spanyards, as alſo the Gaſcoignes, turne the F into H, as <hi>hazer, harina, hijo, hogo, higo,</hi> for <hi>faire,</hi> that is, to do, <hi>farine,</hi> meale, <hi>fils,</hi> a ſonne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>feu,</hi> fire, <hi>figue,</hi> a figge. And this at this time is but too common in Paris, where the women haue learned to ſpeake, as well as to doe, after the Spaniſh manner. Where he ſayth then, that the drugge of the Spaniſh Iugler, or Apothecarie, was called <hi>Higuiero of hell,</hi> it is for diuers reaſons. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the figge tree is a wicked and an infamous tree, the leaues whereof (as we may ſee in the Bible) haue ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued heretofore to couer the priuie parts of our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:4210:99"/> after that they had ſinned, and committed high treaſon againſt their God, their father and creator: euen as the Leaguers to couer their diſobedience and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude againſt their King, and him that hath done the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all good, haue taken the Catholigue, Apoſtoligue, and Romane religion, and thinke therewith to hide their ſhame and ſinne. This is the cauſe alſo why the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licon of Spayne, that is to ſay, the pretext which the King of Spayne, and the Ieſuites and other preachers, wonne by the double duckets of Spayne, haue giuen to the ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and ambitious Leaguers, to rebell againſt their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and lawfull King, and to fall away from him, and to make in their owne countrie, warre more dangerous than ciuill, may very properly bee called, the Figge tree of hell, in ſteed that that wherewith Adam and Eue did couer their open ſinne, was the Figge tree of Paradiſe. And euer ſince that time this tree hath alwaies been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed, and of euill name amongſt men, bearing neither flowers nor any buddes, nor any thing els to garniſh it withall, and the very fruite it ſelfe hath from thence been drawne to name the moſt diſhoneſt part of women, and the moſt filthie and foule diſeaſe that breedeth in the parts, that wee cannot well name. You are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this alſo, that the ancient people did account this tree amongſt the gibbets or gallowſes: as for example, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Timon the Athenian would haue plucked vp one of them that did him ſome anoyance in his garden, and whereupon ſundrie had in former time been hanged, he cauſed to bee proclaimed with the ſound of a trumpet, that if any were willing to be hanged, he ſhould diſpatch and come thither quickly, becauſe he ment to cauſe it to bee pulled vp by the rootes. Plinie teacheth vs, that this tree hath not any ſent or ſauor; no more hath the League. Againe, that it eaſily caſteth her fruite; and ſo hath the League done: that it receiueth all manner of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as the League hath receiued all ſortes of people: and that it doth not laſt or liue long; no more hath the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:4210:100"/> League done: and that the greateſt part of the fruite, which appeareth at the beginning, neuer commeth to ripenes; no more hath that of the League. But that which yet better agreeth with it, and hath many more confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities with the League, than S. Frauncis hath with our Lord, is the Figge tree of the Indies, which the very Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyards themſelues haue named the Figge tree of hell. Concerning which Mathiolus ſayth thus much for truth, that if a man cut but onely one leafe from it, and ſet but the one halfe thereof within the ground, it will take roote there, and afterwards vpon that leaſe there will growe an other leafe, and ſo leaues growing vpon leaues, this plant becommeth hie as it were a tree without bodie, ſtalke, branches, and as it were without rootes, in ſo much that we may reckon it amongſt the miracles of nature. Is there any thing ſo like and ſo much reſembling the League? which of one leafe, that is to ſay, of a very ſmall begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, is become by little and little, from one perſon to an other, to this great height wherein we haue ſeene it: and yet notwithſtanding, becauſe it wanteth a good foote, or a good ſtalke to beare it vp, it withered and decayed at the firſt blaſt. But this is not all. This Figge of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, called (as you haue heard) the Figge tree of hell, bringeth foorth fruite like vnto the common figges, but yet ſomewhat more groſſe and great, finiſhing by the forepart in a crowne, (theſe are the proper tearmes of Mathiolus) and are of colour betweene greene and purple, within there is nothing, ſauing a certaine kinde of puffed matter, as in our figges, but yet ſo full with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine red kind of iuyce, that it tainteth mens hands, as the mulberies or blacke beries do, and cauſeth them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it, to make vrine as red as bloud, wherof many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are greatly afraid. Haue you not ſeene that the League hath had the very ſame effects? The fruites thereof haue been great, and more puffed vp and ſwollen than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fruites, and their end was a crowne, that is to fay, the crowne of France, to which it tended: the colour of the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:4210:100"/> League was greene and red: greene for the ioy that they had of the death of the late king, whereof they did a long while weare the ſcarfe: and red, as well that they might bee knowne in the liueries of the Spanyards, as for the bloud of the good Frenchmen that they ment to ſhed. This Figge tree of hell is ſo common in the Iland of Hiſpaniola, newly diſcouered in the Indies, that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Italian author ſayth, that the whole countrie is full thereof, and that there it commeth as it were in deſpite, euen vnto the courts of their houſes. There is alſo an other Spaniſh Phiſition, named Iohn Fragoſus, that wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of the propertie of a certaine oyle (which they call the oyle of the Figge tree of hell) in theſe tearmes: Some late men that write of the things of the Weſt Indies, haue a peculiar chapter of a certaine oyle that they call, the oyle of the Figge tree of hell, and they ſay, that it commeth from Geliſco, a prouince in newe Spayne. And a little after hee ſayth: It is the ſame that they account <hi>Cherua,</hi> or <hi>Catapucia maior,</hi> which the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians call, <hi>Palma Christi,</hi> or <hi>Mira ſolis.</hi> All which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie declareth, that that which the Italians call <hi>fico d'in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferno,</hi> that is, the Figge tree of hell, it is called by the Spanyards, <hi>Higuera d'inferno,</hi> or in the Caſtillian tongue, <hi>Higuiero d'infierno,</hi> that is as before, the Figge tree of hell. Theſe then are the reaſons that haue moued my couſin, to name the Catholicon of Spayne, the Figge tree of hell; becauſe that the Spanyards ſo call that Figge tree of the Indies, that beareth her fruite full of bloud, as indeed the League hath done. And if a man would proceede yet further, and ſay that that Figge tree is the Palmar, you ſhall finde therein a thouſand other confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities or agreements, which it would be too long to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe vpon: and amongſt other, that which a certaine Phiſition of Africa hath written, that of the tree Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar alone, a man might make all manner of tooles and prouiſions for a ſhippe, yea the very ſhippe it ſelfe,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:4210:101"/> and that the fruite thereof may be applied to all vſes, and ſerueth for bread, for wine, for linnen cloth, for veſſell, for table, for couering of houſes, and in a worde, for all that a man would haue: as the League at the beginning of it, ſerued for all ſortes of people: for all ſortes of hopes, and for all meanes, to couer all ſortes of paſſions, as of hatred, of couetouſnes, of ambition, of reuengement, and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude. There is indeede another tree, which <hi>Baptista Ramuſius,</hi> calleth Higuero, and ſaith that it muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by foure ſillables: but I am ſure it was not the purpoſe of my couſin to ſpeake thereof,<note place="margin">An herbe of the kinde of ſpourge. A kinde of ſpourge, with a leafe like purſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane.</note> no more than of <hi>Lathyris,</hi> or of <hi>Helioſcopion,</hi> which the grammarian <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briſſenſis</hi> calleth alſo <hi>Higuera del infierno,</hi> that is the figge tree of hell, becauſe hee witches and ſhee witches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly vſe it, to worke their charmes and inchauntments by, as the Leaguers haue vſed the name of Catholike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to charme and inchant the people withall. And this as I take it, may ſuffiſe or ſatisfie them, that would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine or diſpute concerning this terme. Some haue tolde my couſin, that diuers thought hardly of it, that hee hath expreſſed the proper names of ſome of the ſeditious and principall authors, of all the miſerie and miſchiefe of France. But I haue heard him ſay, that hee was of ſuch a countrey, where they vſed to call bread, bread; &amp; figges, figges. Thoſe that for money had deliuered their owne citie to Phillip King of Macedonia, complained indeede that his ſouldiers, after the yeelding of it, called them traitors, and vpbraided them with their treaſon. I knowe not (ſaid the King) how to doe you any helpe in this, for my ſouldiers are groſſe and lumpiſh fellowes, and call things by their owne names. Thoſe, who after they had cauſed ſundry townes to reuolt againſt the King, &amp; had as much as they could maintayned warre, and exerciſed al manner of tyrannies againſt the poore people, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ruinated all their neighbours, and who ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues no longer able to holde out, and that there was no more to catch or take, did very dearely ſell thoſe places
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:4210:101"/> to the King, and deliuered vp the poore inhabitants to his mercy, ſhall thoſe I ſay, be angry, if men call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors? But it were a hard matter, that no one word ſhould ſcape the Parreſiens, euen againſt them that haue taken golde and ſiluer, and that haue merchandized, &amp; bought, and ſolde, to come to a certaine price, I wil haue ſo much for doing it. For though that they had done that which they ſhould haue done, (as Iudges that execute iuſtice, which they are bounde to doe) yet for all that, in taking money they haue marred all, and ought not any longer to receiue honor, for their good doing. They cannot ſaue themſelues from this, that men ſhould not call them trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, troublers of the ſtate, merchants, and ſellers of their countrie; and there is none but God alone, that can bring to paſſe, that things alreadie done, ſhould not bee done, neither can hee bring to paſſe, (vnles it bee by a certaine kinde of groſſe forgetfulnes, which hee can bring vpon our ſpirites or vnderſtandings) that wee ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member any more, that which is alreadie paſt. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter one of our poets, (whereof our town Eleuthere, is very well furniſhed) hath ſpoken not many dayes ſince, in ſixe ſmall verſes, <q>
                  <l>Thoſe that thorow ciuill warres for gold and ſiluer told</l>
                  <l>Vnto the King doe ſell, places and townes of hold,</l>
                  <l>Though in my minde, good markets they doe make:</l>
                  <l>(For, for ſome ſmall coyne, they expoſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to ſtrife,</l>
                  <l>And therewithall doe ſell their honor and their life)</l>
                  <l>Yet neuer did honest man this trade vpon him take.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding, if any are to be found, that at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning ſuffered themſelues to be caried away, with the flood of the League, whether it were for feare to forgoe their religion, or for ſome particular affection that they bare to the heads of that ſide, or for ſome diſpleaſure and hatred, that they had conceiued againſt the late King, they are they themſelues, that ſubmitted themſelues to, and that acknowledged, the preſent King, ſo ſoone as they ſaw him to become a catholike: and haue brought
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:4210:102"/> into his power, the places that they helde without mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe, or entring into compoſition with their maſter: and theſe are more excuſable, for their firſt error or fault, than the other: yea they deſerue recommendation and praiſe, and to be put in our chronicles, for that they haue deliuered their countrie from the Spaniſh crueltie, as we ſee to haue bin done to them, that haue freed France from the Engliſh men. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence haue proceeded ſo manie goodly priuiledges, to families, to townes, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munalties, who of themſelues did ſhake off the ſtrange yoke, that they might the better ſubmit themſelues to the ſweet power of their naturall Kings. But that which moſt grieueth all honeſt and virtuous people, is to ſee that they, that haue not done it but by force and neceſſitie, are yet notwithſtanding ioyfully entertained, receiued, and welcommed, and boaſt that they are the cauſe that the King is conuerted. Theſe men cauſe mee to remember a certaine anſwer, that Fabius the great gaue to a Romane captaine, gouernor of Tarentum, who after that hee had ſuffered the towne to bee loſt by the treaſon of the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, bragged of this, that hee was the cauſe, that Fabius tooke it againe. Truely (ſayd Fabius) I had not taken or recouered the towne, if thou hadſt not loſt it: euen ſo may theſe people bragge and boaſt here, that they are the cauſe of ſo many Trophees &amp; triumphes as the King hath atchieued in conquering his realme againe, for without their treaſon and rebellion, he had not gained ſo much honour, as he hath done by bringing them vnder, and ranging them to reaſon. I ſaw alſo others, that haue not ſo much as ſtirred out of their houſes, and from their quiet reſt, to rent and teare the name of the King, and of the princes of the blood of France, as much as they were able, who alſo not being able any longer to withſtand, by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the great neceſſitie that preſſed them, becauſe they had two or three daies, before the reducing of their towne to the Kings obedience, ſome good ſighing and ſenſe to doe better, and yet notwithſtanding at this day,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:4210:102"/> thoſe that ſpeake moſt loftily, and haue great eſtates, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and recompences, and bragge that they haue done more ſeruice to the King, &amp; to Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it ſelf,, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe that forſooke their houſes, their goods, and offices, for to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their prince, and who did willingly indure all maner of needs, rather than ſo much as to winke at the tyrannie of theſe ſtrangers, whether they bee Lorraines, that is of the Guyſian faction, or Spaniards. But this complaint de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth an other Satyre Menippized. But for this time I will tell you no more, but two ſmall quartains or verſes, which two of our good countrie men made by the way, or vpon the ſodaine, as wee ſay, at a certaine time, when we diſcourſed vpon this matter.</p>
            <q>
               <l>If French men lewd, in Fraunce recompenſed bee,</l>
               <l>And the beſt men aduanced to no degree,</l>
               <l>Let vs ſomewhat be lewd: men will forget the offence,</l>
               <l>He that hath not done ill, ſhall haue no recompence.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The other euen at that very inſtant time alſo, purſued the ſelfe ſame matter, and to no leſſe purpoſe, than the former verſes were.</p>
            <q>
               <l>To be welcome indeed, and our affaires well to do,</l>
               <l>During this tedious time, and miſerable to,</l>
               <l>Agnoste my friend, canst tell what way we ſhall take?</l>
               <l>Some place lets ſurpriſe, and then our peace we will make.</l>
            </q>
            <p>I know very wel, that there are many people, that take no delight to heare men ſpeake and write thus freely, and are offended at the firſt worde, that any man mentioneth our afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s alreadie paſt, as though after ſo many great loſſes, they would take away from vs our feeling and our tongue, &amp; our ſpeech, and libertie giuen vs to complaine withall. But herein they ſhould doe worſe vnto vs, than Phalaris did vnto them, whom he ſtifled and choaked in his braſen bull; for hee did not hinder them from crying, but this rather, that he would not heare their cries, as the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:4210:103"/> cries of men, leſt he might haue pittie vpon them, but as the bellowings of bullockes and buls, the better to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe the ſound of mans voice. This is a hard caſe, that they that haue beene pilled, robbed, impriſoned in the Baſtile, ranſomed, and driuen from their townes, &amp; from their charges, ſhould not caſt out ſome euill ſpeech a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, when at their returne, they find their houſes voide, forſaken, ruinated, wherein there is nothing but the bare wals, whereas they left them richly ſtored with moueables, and handſomely trimmed vp, with all maner of things. Who can euer ſtop the mouth of the poſterity, and hinder them from ſpeaking of the third part, and of them that haue brought it out, &amp; nurſed it, &amp; which keep it yet ſhut vp in a chamber, nouriſhing it, and ſuſtaining it with good meate, one day to bring it forth vnto light, and to cauſe it to be ſeene, well fauoured, and very great, when they ſhall ſee time and commoditie fit for it? It was neuer yet heard of, neither ſhall it euer bee, (what lawes or ordinances ſoeuer, men may make therefore) that euill ſpeech ſhould not be better receiued than praiſe, ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when it is drawn from the trueth it ſelfe: and that there is not a hundred times more pleaſure, to ſpeake euill of ſome ſlothfull perſon, than to praiſe an honeſt man. This is the puniſhment that wicked men cannot eſcape, and though they haue all their pleaſures beſide, yet at the leaſt muſt they haue this dipleaſure, &amp; this worme about their hearts, to know that the people teareth them in pieces, &amp; ſecretly curſeth them, and that writers wil not ſpare them after their death. Thanks be to God, we are not vnder any Tiberius, that ſpied out the ſpeeches of his ſubiectes, or that made of all offences newe articles of high treaſon againſt the Prince. He giueth to honeſt people, as much libertie as they ſhould deſire: hee knoweth the naturall diſpoſition of French men, as one that cannot indure, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all bondage, nor all libertie. Likewiſe it were not reaſonable continually and for euer to ſtirre vp our olde
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:4210:103"/> quarrels, and to vſe iniurious faſhions, that might hinder the kitting together againe of his people, in one and the ſame deuotion, vnder his obedience. For it were better to endeuour to ſweeten our euils, than to make them more ſharpe, to the ende that we may all of vs range our ſelues to the ancient fidelitie, and humilitie which wee owe vnto our King, without partialitie, or varietie of minds. Neither ſhould any man thinke it ill, that wee pricke and prouoke them, that ſhewe themſelues to bee reſtiue, and ſeeme as it were to repent that they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented. In all euents whatſoeuer, when there ſhall be no other, but thoſe that are notoriouſly wicked, and yet will bee offended therewithall, I beleeue that the Parreſiens will not bee much grieued therewith. Neither doubt I, but that little Oliuier, and Boucher, and d' Orleans, will bee now much troubled, to make ſome Anticatholicon, and Apologies, againſt the tables and tapiſtries, for they haue now leaſure to ſell them, and many men looke for them, if their Lucubrations and ſtudies, may deſerue ſuch expectation. As concerning my ſelfe, I will alwaies coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell my couſin to buſie himſelfe about ſome other thing, than to anſwer them. But I know more than a dozen in our towne, or citie, whoſe paper and pen are eaten vp, and yet attend but ſome compulſorie matter, to make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, and <hi>vidimus,</hi> out of their Menippized Satyres, much more bloudie then the firſt. If you learne any thing thereof, I pray you my good friend, cauſe me to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſame. You perceiue how to pleaſure you, I haue a little ſtraied from our purpoſe, and haue ſuffered my ſelfe to be tranſported to indignation and wrath, which I haue conceiued againſt thoſe people, that yet build vpon the foundations of the firſt rebellion: and who alſo threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vs, to play with ſharpe and edged ſwords, whereas heretofore they haue plaied but with rebated weapons. And indeede I was not farre off from powring forth my choller vpon the Ieſuites: but becauſe I vnderſtand they
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:4210:104"/> are not like to continue long in this countrie, and by that meanes the Spanyards ſhal haue no greater preſent taſte, (for as a deputie of Bourgongne ſayd well, a Spaniard without a Ieſuite, is as a partrich without an orenge, or ſome other ſauce) I am contented to ſay nothing. But to returne to the point, from which wee haue gone aſide. I pray you, if you doe againe imprint the Satyre Menippized, to blot out of it the names of them, that are become the Kinges good ſeruantes, and who alſo continue therein with ſome good reſolution. And albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it there are ſtill ſome, that yet ſhake in the haft, and haue neede of a yeeres triall at the leaſt, before they may be truſted, or haue their names raſed out of the booke: notwithſtanding, ſith it belongeth not to you or to mee to iudge of them, the beſt way will bee to take out of the booke all proper names, and not to offend any one man of them, that may hurt, and bee in the midſt of vs. And this is that, that I meant to ſay vnto you for the laſt point. And ſo you ſhall leaue mee, if you liſt, to my reſt, for it is nowe ſupper time. And then I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued verie well, that hee ment to giue mee leaue to depart, and I prayed him, that hee would pardon me, becauſe I had bin ſo tedious vnto him, but I had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſo great pleaſure to heare him, that the time ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto mee not to bee long. Notwithſtanding I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him that before I did depart, I might yet a little aduertiſe him, that ſundry men ſaide, that the oration of the Lorde of Aubray, was to too long, and ouer ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in compariſon of them that went before it, which were all very ſhort, and full of fictions: and that I for my part, could not tell either what to anſwere, or what reaſon the author had, to leade him ſo to doe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto hee aunſwered and ſayd, neither doe I, for my part, vnderſtand anie more thereof than you, but that I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that my couſin ment to imitate therein the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall diſpoſition of the ſaide Lorde of Aubray, who is
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:4210:104"/> fo aboundant and plentifull in reaſons, and can neuer finde an ende, either of his knowledge, or of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and ſpecially in ſuch an action, as wherein hee ought to make ſhew of all that hee knewe, and that with a deſire to perſwade, if hee could. But in that he hath made him to ſpeake ſo ſeriouſly, it was to procure vnto him more dignitie and credite, than to thoſe other that went before him, who all of them are ranke knaues, to whome it had not bin ſeemely, to haue made them ſpeake any good thing: and indeede there was none found but hee, in whoſe mouth it was fitte to ſpeake the truth, and to ſet out things that might ſerue for the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſerious knowledge of matters alreadie paſt. And this is all the craft, that men ment thereby, and the coine wherewith they ſhould pay theſe delicate and fine eared men, in whoſe power it is, to pare and cut off from it, or els to read no more, but the fourth part or halfe of it, as they themſelues liſt, if they thinke the whole too long. But in this matter I referre my ſelfe to men of better iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether there bee any thing in it, that a man may take away, and which is not verie fitly applyed to the purpoſe. Notwithſtanding it is permitted you, to cut it, or pare it, as ſhall beſt like you, I for my parte, will not thinke the wine the worſe therefore. And ſo to conclude, I pray you leaue me alone in peace to my ſelfe. Hereupon I durſt not further preſſe him, though indeede I had verie great deſire to knowe, whether hee or the Lorde Agnoſte, had not done ſomething touching the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Ieſuites, but hee ſtopped my mouth, and ſaid vnto mee, wee are accuſtomed according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our countrie, to ſpeake that that wee thinke. I will therefore tell you, that I ſuppoſe that wee haue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed enough at this time, and I yet once againe pray you to leaue mee in peace, or let mee bee alone, which when he had ſpoken, he called his ſeruant and ſaid, let one come, and lay the cloth: wherupon I was aſhamed
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:4210:105"/> to tary any longer, and came away inſtructed and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with theſe good anſwers, which I thought good to communicate vnto you, for the contentation and ſatisfying of them, that are as my ſelfe, curious to know the truth.</p>
